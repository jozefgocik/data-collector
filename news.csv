2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:03:47Z,Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool: Premier League – live reaction,"There’s a thousand-yard stare from Vitor Pereira as his coaches discuss where it all went wrong. The truth is Forest didn’t see it out. Liverpool’s players are delighted, with Ibrahima Konate whelping in delight. VAR lightning didn’t strike twice for Alexis Mac Allister. What late drama in a game that was going nowhere. Nottingham Forest will rue a first half where they could not score. Liverpool were poor until they brought on Rio Ngumoha. 90+8 min: There’s a VAR check. A long look. Aina had played Van Dijk onside. Pereira is incandescent with rage. Mac Allister has his goal. Didn’t even need his backside to break his duck. A long throw chance for Joe Gomez. The ball comes out, Szoboszlai’s ball in, Van Dijk’s header and Mac Allister bundles in after Ortega knocks it out… 90+5 min: Mac Allister has not scored all season, waiting for one off his backside, and when he did, it was denied by VAR. 90+3 min: Some confusion over how many minutes have been added on. Nobody knows anything. Think seven minutes were added. Sangare has a dig from distance. And why not? 90+1 min: That would have been the weirdest goal of the season. But the rules dictate that cannot stand. The roar from the Forest fans was so loud as Anthony Taylor, briefly, became the darling of West Bridgford. 90 min: But here’s VAR. Did the ball strike the arm? Yes, it did. The elbow. So no goal. Oh lordy. Where did that come from from? Ngumoha forces the ball in, and then Ekitike heads at Ortega, a fine save, and as Aina tries to clear, Mac Allister challenges and the ball balloons in. Bizarre…. 88 min: Lucca nods the corner back but Ndoye’s shot is blocked. Instead, Liverpool try to attack and Chiesa is squeezed off. Gomez can launch another long throw. Forest deal well enough with that. 87 min: Gomez knocks behind as Ndoye chases a ball across the penalty area. Forest win a corner, and then another in quick succession. 86 min: Oof! Close! The closest. Alisson mishandles a ball from Ndoye, and it drops to Gibbs-White. His shot grubs off the floor and then Sangare smashes wide. 85 min: Liverpool in Forest territory and Ortega flicks away a Gomez throw flicked on by Van Dijk. Forest more penned in now, looking to the counterattack. 83 min: Feels like a while since any actual football was played here. Andy Robertson is coming on for Liverpool, for Kerkez, who has done OK. Joe Gomez comes on for Curtis Jones to sit in the Spinal Tap drummer’s stool. 81 min: Kevin McManus gets in touch: “When Ekitike is having an off day like today our forward line is innocuous. We love Salah for everything he has done for us but there has been a massive drop-off since latter part of last season. Gakpo baffles me. Apparently the data says differently but I have never seen what he brings. Going to need a header from Virgil or another screamer from Dominik.” That’s about the size of it.. 80 min: Latest score: Sunderland 1-2 Fulham (Enzo La Fee) A goal here feels unlikely. Both teams not finding it, instead they are grinding it. 78 min: Forest changes: Anderson for Dominguez, Jesus for Lucca. Liverpool changes: Salah goes off, it’s been a miserable afternoon, as does Gakpo, and on come Chiesa and Ngumoha. Salah was not happy at all. Slot cannot have been happy with him. 75 min: Les Lagan gets in touch: “I always thought Stanley Park - quite a large field - was in the Anfield Road area.” Is a park a field? Answers on a postcard to… Rod Wooden gets in touch: “John, for me the player that Liverpool have missed most this season is Luis Díaz, who never seems to be mentioned in this particular discussion. Maybe I’m only saying this because I live in Colombia, but their attack this season has lost its sparkle, and he provided it.” David Wall enters the chat: “Perhaps it’s a sign that we need more critical thinking taught in schools but i don’t understand why Slot having won with a team built by Klopp is a criticism of Slot. After all, Klopp didn’t win with that same team, he could only manage them to third. So if Slot achieved more with the same resources that implies he’s out-performed Klopp. “Perhaps you can argue that team building is also part of managing, and to an extent that’s true. But the main skill in management is making the best use of your resources, whatever they happen to be That’s why the manager-of-the-year awards don’t always go to the manager of the champions but sometimes to the manager of the team that has most out-performed what would be expected given their budget. And in that respect Slot did better than Klopp comparing them over the previous two seasons.” 73 min: Forest are sat deep as Liverpool attempt to thread passes. This is where Wirtz might come in handy. As it is, he’s sat in the stand having missed out with an as yet unspecified problem. 71 min: Salah goes on a run, bumps into Williams and then gives up on the ball. That was not good. That was not the Salah we have known for so long. 70 min: Konate is penalised for smashing into Jesus. Then Jesus is penalised for fouling the same player. It’s bitty, but at last opens up, and Bakwa has space and time. Too much, it turns out, and he drags his shot wide. 68 min: It’s ebbing away, this game. Feels like one goal wins it, though the defences are very much on top. 66 min: An ironic smile on the face of Mohamed Salah, after he gets no change from a clash with Neco Williams. Two Forest changes: Ndoye on for Hudson-Odoi while Hutchinson is replaced by Bakwa. 64 min: Aina’s cross briefly looks as if it might end up in the net, but drifts over to Liverpool’s relief. Latest score: Sunderland 0-2 Fulham (Raul Jimenez) Jimenez scored in the earlier game this season between the team. What a job Marco Silva is doing, by the way. 63 min: Slot still looks annoyed on the sideline. Vitor Pereira is in perpetual motion. This game is fully in the balance. 61 min: News from Crystal Palace, where Ladislav Krejci of Wolves has been red-carded for a second yellow. It’s still 0-0. 59 min: Liverpool now pressing high, too. Forest getting far less time on the ball.l Latest score: Sunderland 0-1 Fulham (Jimenez, 54) 58 min: Much better from Liverpool who are now controlling possession in the manner that would be expected. The game has slowed down a little, too, which may be to Arne Slot’s tastes. 57 min: On second glance that’s a fine save from Ortega, and made harder by the outbreak of actual sun in the Nottingham area. 55 min: Salah does well to direct the ball back to Jones and Ortega is asked to make a snap save. 54 min: Some noise from the Liverpool fans. The fields of Anfield Road are sung for. It’s been a long time since there were actual fields in the Anfield Road area. 52 min: Liverpool at least look as if they intend to attack in this half. Konate releases Mac Allster who gets his shot blocked. 50 min: Milenkovic loses the ball when he is back defending to Salah but there are no consequences. Salah can do nothing with the ball. 49 min: Ekitike clears the corner as first man. The set pieces have not been good in this game. Milenkovic heads over from Hudson-Odoi’s cross that wasn’t quite the right angle for the big defender. 47 min: Liverpool force a corner, their first. It soon results in a second. Forest struggle to clear that but eventually Hutchinson comes away and wins a Forest corner. 46 min: N0 changes at half-time. Jamie Carragher, on Sky’s broadcast, has called that “one of the worst halves I have seen from Liverpool all season”. That’s saying something. Tony Barr gets in touch: “Not sure how much Slot had a say in the transfers, but let’s play this out: “Trent leaves on a free was definitely up to him. Not much LFC can do if a player decides they want to play for Los Blancos for truckload of Euros. Arne, would you like the best striker in the PL, other than Halaand? Hmm let me think about that…Arne would you like Germany’s generational attacking pkahmaking talent? Hmmm let me think about that. ”Hindsight is 20:20. The best time for renewal is when things are going well. I’d rather look at the gamble taken to not to fully bolster the central defence or not find a fledgling replacement for Mo…” Ian Copestake gets back in touch: “We might see a sub subbed at halftime with Gomez coming on for Jones. Then the rightback curse will rub its hands again.” And from Brian Kitt: “Freddie Woodman on the bench for Liverpool sounds like he could tell the Forest for the trees.” Liverpool have two goalies on the bench for some reason. Dave Estherby gets in touch: “I think it’s interesting that the whole, “Slot won with Klopp’s team” thing only started at the beginning of this season after a pretty disastrous summer in the transfer market; Letting (one of) your best player(s) leave for free and not replacing him, being sold an absolute pup by Newcastle, not recognizing the captain’s race is run, not getting a better backup for an injury-prone goalkeeper and finally, well, Florian Wirtz. Slot had at least a hand in all these decisions.” Nottingham Forest 0-0 Liverpool Crystal Palace 0-0 Wolves Sunderland 0-0 Fulham It’s the best league in the world, don’t you know? It’s been bad from Liverpool, good from Forest, so Liverpool ought to be relieved while Forest must be frustrated. They have been excellent in all but the scoring goals and creating proper chances discipline. A word for Liverpool’s defenders, who have been put through quite the workload but held firm. 45+3 min: Milenkovic launches one over the bar, and that should be the end of the action for the first 45. 45+2 min: Some loud screams from the bench? Slot or Pereira? You decide. 45+1 min: Three minutes were added on. Liverpool are about to feel the lash of the Slot tongue in the dressing room. In midfield an attack, they have been not much short of dreadful. 45 min: Forest push on for the goal their first half deserves. Liverpool’s defenders deserve some credit for their good work. Anderson gets chance to shoot but drifts his attempt over the bar. Pereira is full of angst once more. 43 min: Another timely block, this time from Szoboszlai, as Gibbs-White tries to shoot. The one-way traffic continues. But the corner is again a waste. Will Forest live to regret this? 41 min: Alisson is forced to tip behind when Hutchinson scoops in a cross. Corner ball. This one goes deep and the danger recedes for now. Jesus misdirects his header when the ball comes back in. 40 min: Van Dijk has made a goal saving intervention just when Igor Jesus shaped to shoot. Vitor Pereira throws his head back in angst. 39 min: Ian Copestake gets in touch: “May the Liverpool players never have days off before a game. They still seem to be on a beach.” Thought the same of Chelsea’s Dubai crew on Saturday. Tim Woods did too: “No radio commentary of the game in Germany, and a lot of pubs have stopped showing English games due to the cost. So I am gratefully following your updates, with Berlin radio helping the afternoon along; outings for Roxette, Alphaville and even Johnny Hates Jazz so far!” Shattered dreams. 38 min: Gravenberch rages when he’s penalised for fouling Anderson. This is a frustrated Liverpool team. 36 min: Salah gets chance to cross. And it’s awful. His descent this season has been uncomfortable to watch. 35 min: Forest still looking for that golden moment. Perhaps inviting on Liverpool can open up space. Hugo Ekitike – forgot he was playing. 34 min: Another loose Salah touch – he’s not had many touches at all – and Sangare takes the ball off him. 32 min: Van Dijk has taken another blow to the head, after Igor Jesus clatters the ball into his face. Curtis Jones been shifted to right-back, it seems. With Szoboszlai to midfield. 30 min: It’s been a poor half hour from Liverpool but they remain level. 28 min: Florian Wirtz, in fetching woolly hat, is sat in the stands. Liverpool all at sea as Alisson has to skid out of goal to prevent a corner as Konate dallies. The long throw is not good, a waste of a situation. 26 min: Lovely piece of control from Anderson, who kills a high ball stone dead with w waft of his boot. Forest have some good players, and Anderson leads the list. 25 min: Gibbs-White is fouled by Konate, whose considerable bulk lands on his victim’s foot in the aftermath. An accident but that will bruise. 24 min: Kari Tulinius gets in touch: “Early days and all that, but Vitor Pereira’s Trees seem like a trickier side to play against than Dyche’s. There’s a lot more closing down of opponents with the ball, and attacks are more frenetic. On the whole they run a lot more. Difficult to play against, but given the added workload of European football, which Pereira didn’t have with Wolves, I imagine that Forest will tire after a few weeks of this.” 23 min: Fair to say Wirtz is being missed? Forest continue to be all over Liverpool who cannot keep hold of the ball at the moment. 21 min: Hudson-Odoi is to the fore, as he has been all game. Can Forest make something of their dominance of possession? Hutchinson at least tests Alisson but his shot is something of a pea-roller. No trouble for the great man. 20 min: The referee, Anthony Taylor, is not a popular man in Nottingham, from experience. “It’s all about you” is one song they sing. 19 min: A delegation around the ball. Taken short and Murillo smashes with his left peg. The Liverpool wall holds firm and then Gakpo does some decent defensive work. Gibbs-White is booked for not retreating from a free-kick. 17 min: More defending to do for Liverpool. Murillo has a shot blocked, and then Van Dijk and Anderson clash heads, which brings the game to a temporary halt. Both are OK. Forest have a free-kick after Igor Jesus was fouled. 16 min: A Mr Keet gets in touch: “I get really bored of the “Klopp’s team” thing, and the idea in general that managers are responsible for “building” teams. Klopp and Slot, and managers of most other big teams, are part of a recruitment team and, typically, won’t have the final say on transfers (just an input.) Yes, slot benefitted from inheriting a good side, and one that had been well coached by klopp. He then had to manage them and coach them for an entire season in order to win the league. Take training, set the tactics, motivate the team.” 14 min: Jeremy Boyce gets in touch: “I can’t help seeing this fixture without hearing the echoes of the terrible events at Hillsborough in 1989, when these two, at that time, giants of the English game briefly clashed before the tragedy at the Leppings Lane end. Much water has flowed under the bridges of the Trent and Mersey since then and the two have enjoyed vastly differing fortunes. Never mind whether Slot won the League with Jurgen’s team, what is clear to see is that Liverpool have always prioritised continuity in the dug out, whereas.... Does Pereira understand what and who he’s taking on within his own club, never mind the oppos on the pitch ? Another new manager, another new style ? We’re about to find out...” 13 min: The weapon of choice was a training round routine that Forest hurriedly beat away. 12 min: Gakpo passes the ball into open space, a no look, no clue pass, and Forest can go again. They too lose position and Sangare fouls Gravenberch. Is this in Szoboszlai’s range? 11 min: Anderson strides forward and shoots just wide. Forest are all over Liverpool at the moment. 10 min: Aina sets off on a give and go, and is knocked over by Mac Allister. The free-kick is a long way out. And taken short, Van Dijk heads the eventual cross away. There are claims that Gibbs-White was fouled by Gravenberch but nothing doing, not even on VAR. 8 min: Sangare is asked to shoot by the home fans but Forest hold on to the ball. They’ve been good so far. Liverpool are struggling with their zest. 7 min: The corner is low and a waster, not beating the first man. Pereira reaches for his notebook. 6 min: Anderson’s ball to Hudson-Odoi sees Konate come across to clean up, and a corner results, Forest’s first. 5 min: Gakpo, who seems ever all but ever present, chases the ball down the channels. When Salah gets chance to make an incursion, his touch is loose. As it often is these days, sadly. 3 min: Pressure put on Virgil van Dijk gives Forest a glimmer, and then the ball comes back to Forest. Hudson-Odoi takes the ball down, shoots and Alisson comes to the rescue. That was close. It could have been much better than close. 2 min: Liverpool settle into some early possession. It’s loud at the City Ground which is louder these days than it often was in days of yore. 1 min: Curtis Jones is in midfield, Szoboszlai lines up at right-back. Forest are going for a league double over Liverpool. It’s been a strange old season for them. Footage of Wirtz does not suggest serious injury, but he told the coaches he could not play. Will Curtis Jones now play right-back? Vitor Pereira is applauded as he walks out for the first half. Nottingham Forest fans are rather too used to this type of thing by now. Curtis Jones steps in, after an injury in the warm-up. Or so we think. It may be sickness. Eric Peterson gets in touch: “I wouldn’t mind Wayne Rooney pulling on an old Everton kit and getting on some podcast to remind Arne Slot, “Easy there, sport. You say that the only thing you and Jurgen Klopp have in common is that you both won the league. That’s not true. You both won the league with Jurgen’s team. Whether you can build a champion of your own is a different question.” Arne Slot just spoke to Sky, starting with Dominik Szoboszlai at full-back: “He needs to be because that’s what we need. We have our issues, especially in defence. Missing our 2 fullbacks, but Dominic has done that job really well. Last week, Curtis Jones, did his job really well. So that’s the good thing about midfielders, they are usually able to play in more positions than only in the midfields. “A little bit of a different challenge. because a manager head coach has impact on playing style, but in the end, they’re still the same players. And I think they have a lot of quality players. “Sometimes games can be equal on set pieces and then other parts of the game are also important. But as I said so many times, it’s very, very, very hard to win a game of football if you concede more set-pieces than you score. So that’s why it just has always been an important part of the game. But that is even increased even more this season.” Matt Dony gets in touch: “I hope Neco Williams has a great game, and all Liverpool’s goals(!) come down the other flank. I really thought he’d be the successor to TAA, and he’d be a superstar for Wales. He’s obviously very good, can be a really lovely footballer to watch, but just never quite became what we were hoping. The difference between ‘good’ and ‘great’ is such a fine line in so many ways, but a yawning chasm in others.” Vitor Pereira is currently sat on his own in the Forest dugout but spoke to Sky Sports, starting with that big win at Fenerbahce: “It was special mentally. The team was there in the first minute. This is the squad we need, mentally and tactically. And this is what we need today. “We need to be organised when we are defending, we need to be committed with the team. We need the spirit to run, win duels and when we have the ball, it’s about quality and talent. Expressing themselves. I try to give them confidence to do that. We cannot face a game thinking about the position in the table. “In my opinion, we need to do our best, be ourselves because I don’t want a team that plays in a way, then changes a way to play. I want a team with identity, trusts themselves and have confidence in the way we are working to play.” For Forest, an unchanged team from Fenerbahce, while for Liverpool, two changes from Brighton in the FA Cup, Ryan Gravenberch in for Curtis Jones and Hugo Ekitike in for Federico Chiesa. That looks like Szoboszlai at right-back, with Gravenberch as midfield anchor. Nottingham Forest: Ortega, Aina, Milenkovic, Murillo, Williams, Sangare, Anderson, Hutchinson, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi, Igor Jesus. Subs: Gunn, Morato, Ndoye, Dominguez, Lucca, Yates, Jair Cunha, McAtee, Bakwa. Liverpool: Alisson, Szoboszlai, Konate, van Dijk, Kerkez, Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo, Ekitike. Subs: Mamardashvili, Gomez, Chiesa, Jones, Robertson, Nyoni, Ramsay, Morrison, Ngumoha. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) Arne Slot was in punchy mood in his Friday press conference. And it went well for Pereira back at Fenerbahce. I was at Vitor Pereira’s unveiling earlier this week. He spoke well, I thought. All change at Forest – again – with Vitor Pereira the third new manager to be shown off to the City Ground this season. His reign started well in midweek with a good Europa League win. Now for Liverpool, on the revival path though rueing defeats to Bournemouth and Manchester City. They’re in a serious race for the top four/five while Forest stare down the relegation battle. Plenty to play for, in a fixture of rich history."
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:03:43Z,Winter Olympics men’s ice hockey final: USA beat Canada in overtime to end 46-year wait for gold – live reaction,"The handshake line is polite but maybe with fewer smiles than a typical Stanley Cup postgame. It’s just so tough for Canada to deal with this. Jack Hughes: “It’s all about our country right now. I love the USA. I love my teammates. The USA Hockey brotherhood is so strong. … “Unbelievable game by Hellebuyck. He was our best player by far.” A touching tribute here to Johnny Gaudreau, a stalwart US player killed in an accident in 2024. They parade a No. 13 jersey with his name on it around the ice. This one is going to be very difficult for Canada to swallow. They could’ve been up 4-1 at the end of regulation. Hellebuyck was one reason why that didn’t happen. A couple of dubious calls didn’t help. But they simply didn’t get it done, despite smothering the USA for nearly all of the second and third periods. The USA held on. And held on some more. And some more. And then Canada didn’t play smart hockey when overtime started, and the USA took advantage. Teamwork bests 1-on-1 ability. USA pass forward and work it to Jack Hughes. It’s over. McDavid again flies solo. Again, nothing doing. (That was QUINN Hughes, btw. There are two.) McDavid tries to win it all himself. Poked away. Hughes gets a chance the other way. Binnington barely gets a glove to it! Here’s what we’re going to do … You know the score. It’s 1-1. The final score will be 2-1. It’s just a question of who scores first. The time is only relevant in the sense that there’s an 18-minute break between each period for resurfacing the ice. Here we go … Tiebreaking procedure: The Olympics no longer have a shootout in a gold medal game. They’ll play 20 minutes of sudden-death (“golden goal” in more positively framed parlance) overtime. Then another. Then another. You don’t have anywhere to be, do you? The US offense hasn’t been generating chances, and Hellebuyck looks like he could deflect blaster shots like a Jedi in Star Wars. Email from Sven Dobbelaere: “Greetings from a European who, well honestly watches one ice hockey game in probably 10 years :) It’s gripping stuff, I’d honestly award the American goalie a gold medal for the saves alone!” He’ll probably be getting some awards no matter the outcome here. Replay shows a Canadian player appealing for a four-minute power play against the USA by pointing to a newly broken tooth. It’s tempting to say this sport was invented by dentists. For the record, NBC’s Mike Tirico also made the comparison between Hellebuyck’s save and Holtby’s. It’s not just the thoughts of a crazed Washington Capitals fan. Replay shows details of a scramble in which the puck was flipped over Hellebuyck, but McAvoy had placed himself in the net to make the unofficial save. Several qualities and people are responsible for keeping the USA in this game long enough to go to overtime … A stunning miss by Nathan MacKinnon. Connor Hellebuyck’s perfectly played angles and one spectacular save, reaching back with his stick to deny Toews. Luck. Bad officiating. Scrappy defense. Luck. Hellebuyck. Since the shot that pinged off the iron near the end of the second period, the US offense has been dormant. It doesn’t matter now. We’ll go to sudden-death OT, with each team having three skaters. Canada keep up the pressure. But they lose control with five seconds left. Are you ready for overtime? Power play over, 48 seconds in regulation … Canada 1-1 USA, 1:03 left, 3rd period: Hellebuyck again comes up big and knocks the puck away. Canada’s power play has generated several shots from five feet away, but they can’t place one past the US goalie. Canada 1-1 USA, 2:10 left, 3rd period: The 4-on-4 is over. Canada on the attack. Canada 1-1 USA, 2:51 left, 3rd period: 4-on-4 for 49 seconds, and if no one scores there, it’ll be a 1:11 Canadian power play. It should be 3:11. Canada 1-1 USA, 3:23 left, 3rd period: It was Jack Hughes with the high stick. Canada played keepaway for vital seconds, killing the power play while the USA couldn’t touch the puck. It’ll be 4-on-4 for 49 seconds. Surely this is a four-minute double major, right? No? This is absurd. A TRIP! We’ll have a delayed penalty. Canada pull the goalie. Canada clear and get a line change. 1:35 left. Cleared. BIG SAVE BINNINGTON. In fairness, straight at his chest. 1:45 Canada take it up the ice short-handed. Not a serious scoring threat, but it kills time. 2:15 left SHOT! SAVE! Rebound, cleared. 2:42 left in the power play. US in the zone but not able to create a chance yet. 3:00 Will update with time checks on the power play. No US action yet, 3:20 left. That’s … fortunate. Bennett was turning around from the boards with his stick up and didn’t notice Hughes. They call it a double minor. Four minutes. Only 6:34 left, and the USA will spend a lot of that on the power play. Delayed penalty coming up for the USA. They maintain possession. Let’s see a replay. The USA shoot from beyond the blue line. That’s their 22nd shot. Canada have 39. Canada 1-1 USA, 7:34 left, 3rd period: So which was the bigger miss – McKinnon hitting the side of the net or the officials not noticing a US player playing the puck as he was leaving, which gave the USA seven players in action. Canada 1-1 USA, 7:40 left, 3rd period: Have the USA weathered the storm? Binnington is under pressure now. But now a terrible miss by the officiating crew! Too many men on the ice. That was blatant. Can officials from other countries count? Maybe give THEM the assignment from now on. Then a scramble in front of the US net! Every Canadian player takes a whack at it. Wayne Gretzky probably came out and shot at some point. Canada 1-1 USA, 9:15 left, 3rd period: Score and time update BEST CHANCE FOR THE USA so far. Binnington sprawls for the stop. WHAT A MISS BY MCKINNON! The Canadian star has the net at his mercy from an acute angle and hits the side of the net. Canada 1-1 USA, 11:00 left, 3rd period: Remember back in the first period, when the USA were quicker to every loose puck? Not any more. Canada 1-1 USA, 12:15 left, 3rd period: The shot count is 36-17. How much longer can Hellebuyck keep it level? Canada 1-1 USA, 13:01 left, 3rd period: Makar ties up one of the Tkachuks. Tom Wilson wins possession to keep the puck in the USA zone. Canada whips in one shot. Then another. The USA are hanging on for dear life here. Canada 1-1 USA, 13:31 left, 3rd period: Giveaway next to the USA goal, but Canada can’t find a good angle to shoot. The USA simply cannot string any passes together. Canada 1-1 USA, 14:49 left, 3rd period: Hellebuyck makes his 34th save of the game and hangs on. This is turning into an instant classic. BREAKAWAY FOR CELEBRINI after a sloppy play by the US attack. But Hellebuyck cuts down the angle, and the shot is untroubling. Canada 1-1 USA, 16:38 left, 3rd period: Canada are dominating. The shot count is 31-17 now. And yet … the longer this goes, the more likely the USA are to sneaking one in. They already hit both posts near the end of the second period. Canada 1-1 USA, 17:56 left, 3rd period: HOW DID THAT NOT GO IN?! Marner shoots. It deflects to Toews, who gets his stick behind Hellebuyck in the crease and shoots into what is briefly an empty net. Too briefly. Hellebuyck stretches back and gets his stick on it. Shades of Braden Holtby in the 2018 playoffs. Canada 1-1 USA, 19:05 left, 3rd period: We start this period the way much of the second period proceeded – with icing calls against the USA. Start third period … Twenty minutes to gold. Or more. About hockey fighting … One of the most analyzed aspect of sports is the hockey “code,” unwritten rules that tell players when and how they can drop the gloves and engage. In one sense, it’s charming. NHL rules harshly (and reasonably) punish anyone who tries to turn a 1-on-1 fight into a 2-on-1. No matter how mad one team may be at the other, there are lines not to be crossed. Many enforcers won’t pick fights with injured players. Dueling with someone significantly smaller is frowned upon. And there are countless stories of enforcers talking about who’s buying the beer and the pizza after the game. And sometimes, fights serve no apparent purpose, as seen in this classic video of someone taking on legendary puncher Georges Laraque, with one of the funniest buildups ever caught on audio. Fighters are often trying to just swing the momentum in a game. But the most vociferous defenders of the practice insist that it’s also a necessary self-policing safety valve. If players couldn’t drop the gloves to keep each other honest, they insist, players would instead resort to dirty play. And yet the most meaningful games in the sport – Olympics, most Stanley Cup playoff games – proceed without punching. Also, few people ever dissect the actions that led to a fight. A tough hit on a star player? Forgetting to tip the bar staff the night before? No one ever knows. And The Code suggests that players should leave such matters on the ice. What a shock THAT would’ve been! Killing a 5-on-3 power play is normally a massive momentum boost for the penalty-killing team. But the USA’s advantage was brief. Canada piled on the pressure – pass after pass, shot after shot – while the US defensemen chased ghosts. Canada’s lead in the shot count is now 27-16. And yet this game is still tied only by a couple of millimeters after that last US shot. The USA get a chance that goes double-doink off two posts! Canada quite relieved there. We’ll end the period with some argy-bargy near the US bench. Canada 1-1 USA, 1:00 left, 2nd period: We’re hearing “ole, ole, ole, ole” in the stands. Nice change of pace. Canada 1-1 USA, 1:33 left, 2nd period: Toews got the assist on that goal, so the two defensemen who were to blame for the USA goal have combined to even it up. They’ve had stellar games since then. It’s no more than Canada deserve. They win the faceoff, flip it back to Makar, and he sends a laser through Hellebuyck’s arm and leg pads. Canada 0-1 USA, 1:50 left, 2nd period: Icing on the USA. Rinse, repeat. Is anything more stupidly entertaining than hockey fights? Canada 0-1 USA, 2:30 left, 2nd period: Icing on the USA. Canada definitely in the ascendancy, now outshooting the USA 24-15. The broadcasters focus on the stadium organist. As one should. The Capitals have fallen apart since parting ways with their organist. Canada 0-1 USA, 3:08 left, 2nd period: A US player loses a stick. Canada try to capitalize. Makar shoots from relatively close range, Hellebuyck smothers, and we have shoves that turn into half-hearted punches for some reason. Canada 0-1 USA, 4:35 left, 2nd period: Is this the inverse of the women’s final, where Canada got a goal and held on for much of the game? Another good shot for Canada – now 22-15, and Hellebuyck is making a case for MVP honors in this final. Canada 0-1 USA, 5:13 left, 2nd period: Now Canada create some chances, and Toews just misses as he rushes toward the post. McDavid, who has to be in the conversation if you’re talking about the best player in the world at the moment, also had a chance in that sequence. Canada 0-1 USA, 6:05 left, 2nd period: Canada’s turn to be pinned back. They finally clear, but the USA bring it right back in. You can sense the momentum firmly behind the team that just killed a 5-on-3. Canada 0-1 USA, 7:27 left, 2nd period: Tom Wilson chases after the puck to try to prevent an icing call, and he’s held off by the retreating US defense. Then he takes a skate to the head. Helmets are good. Canada 0-1 USA, 7:57 left, 2nd period: Canadian shot deflected high. We’re back at full strength on each side. That’s a glaring missed opportunity. Teams don’t often get 90 seconds of 5-on-3. Canada 0-1 USA, 8:09 left, 2nd period: Canada win the faceoff. They have a player open at the doorstep, but they can’t connect. 5-on-3 over. Chants of USA. Then Canada commits an elementary error, getting called for icing on their own power play, which is almost over. Celebrini with a shot that never had a chance. Now a better one, but Hellebuyck is equal to it. Only 8 seconds left in the 5-on-3. McKinnon whips a shot wide, and the USA clear. They’re able to change. Then they stop Canada from getting in to the zone. Going for quick commentary during the 5-on-3. USA win a faceoff and clear. Canada 0-1 USA, 10:05 left, 2nd period: Canada 43.75% on the power play in this tournament. USA 100% penalty killing. But now it’s going to be 5-on-3!! For a full 1:33. McAvoy with an ill-timed grab. This is pivotal. If Canada can’t score here, the USA will be in their heads. Canada 0-1 USA, 10:33 left, 2nd period: Sustained possession for the USA now … But it’s a breakaway to McDavid! He’s in alone on Hellebuyck, but he’s stopped. He may have wanted a penalty on that one. Replay shows it was pretty close to penalty-shot territory. NOW it’s a penalty on the next sequence, and Canada will have their first power play. Canada 0-1 USA, 12:10 left, 2nd period: Replay from the big US shot a couple of minutes ago – Brock Nelson was the beneficiary of the Toews giveaway, and he may rue his placement on that opportunity. Oh, surely that’s a penalty! No? How about the other end? No? OK, cool. The referees are getting a wonderful view of the game, at least. Canada 0-1 USA, 12:46 left, 2nd period: Canada’s passes are crisp, and Hellebuyck once again has to be at his sharpest. Canada now up 13-10 in shots. The USA haven’t had any possession in the offensive zone in several minutes. But now the puck is loose, and Binnington has to smother. Canada 0-1 USA, 13:54 left, 2nd period: It’s all Canada – until Toews gives it away! Huge stop by Binnington. Canada 0-1 USA, 15:04 left, 2nd period: Hellebuyck is under intense pressure now. Long-range shots, short-range shots. His defense is scrambling to cope with the Canadian attack. Marchand with a big shot forces a good save. Canada 0-1 USA, 16:24 left, 2nd period: Makar with some incisive passes, but his Canadian teammates can’t quite finish. Canada 0-1 USA, 18:17 left, 2nd period: McDavid with a chance! It hits Hellebuyck and then trickles wide of the post. Then a half-decent chance at the other end. Canada 0-1 USA, 19:08 left, 2nd period: Why do players grow playoff beards but not Olympic beards? Just wondering. Canada 0-1 USA, 19:34 left, 2nd period: We had some line shuffling for Canada. It’ll take me some time to sort it out, so just … trust me. The lines have changed. First shot of the period to the USA, and they now lead 9-8 in shots. Second-period faceoff … Canada needs to dig out of a hole … A quick peek at what this sport means in Canada, on Bluesky. Bluesky also has a call to add a Spring and a Fall Olympics. I’m in. It’s going to be a long 28 months or so until the next Olympics. We’ve been spoiled by having four in less than five years post-pandemic. Day 4: I’m getting really sick of the music they play on the broadcast feeds during breaks in the action. Day 17: I’m going to miss this music. Guardian correspondents are sharing some of their favorite moments of the Games on our multisport blog: Nervy moments after a bad giveaway in the Canadian zone. The USA have nearly evened out the shot count. It’s 8-7 Canada. Should be some soul-searching in the Canadian locker room. Too many defensive errors. Too slow and deliberate in the attack. Too willing to settle for shots from the blue line. US defensemen have made their share of errors as well, but they’re generally winning the battles in their own end when it counts. Canada 0-1 USA, 0:48 left, 1st period: Canada kill the power play, then get called for icing. Credit to Toews for atoning for his earlier mistake with a strong defensive play in front of his net. Canada 0-1 USA, 1:33 left, 1st period: Theodore is the unlucky Canadian whistled for hooking, though it’s far less than what Eichel did in exactly the same spot. Again, I’ll ask why this game is being officiated by a USA/Canada crew. Is this figure skating? Canada 0-1 USA, 2:57 left, 1st period: It’ll be a USA power play. That’s a weaaaaak call. Canada 0-1 USA, 4:00 left, 1st period: Acute-angled shot, and Binnington has to smother it. For the most part, the USA have opted for quality over quantity on their shots, but that’s a good change of pace to make the Canadian goalie think. Canada 0-1 USA, 4:49 left, 1st period: Canada lay the puck back to Sanheim, and he rips it on frame. Hellebuyck snags it. The USA probably won’t mind if the defensemen have to take all of Canada’s shots. I’m reminded that for some reason I find the US players’ habit of gnawing on their mouthguards during breaks in the action really off-putting. Maybe it’s because I need to get a cavity filled this week. Canada 0-1 USA, 5:00 left, 1st period: Binnington has to make an awkward save as Canada’s defense again can’t cope with some pressure. Canada just seems tighter. The USA are playing with gleeful abandon, and they’re winning every loose puck in their own zone. Canada 0-1 USA, 6:50 left, 1st period: USA’s Eichel very lucky not get a hooking call. Canada have outshot the USA 7-2. But the USA have had the better chances, even aside from the goal. Matthew Tkachuk sends one skittering across the front of the goal. Canada 0-1 USA, 8:38 left, 1st period: Makar threads a shot from the blue line with some pace, but Hellebuyck hangs on. Good Canadian pressure here. Canada 0-1 USA, 9:55 left, 1st period: Marchand, another villain to all opposing fans in the NHL but probably temporarily forgiven by Canadian fans for now, clumsily surrenders the puck twice. Celebrini, though, rips a shot that pops off Hellebuyck’s leg pad. Officiating note: The referees are Gord Dwyer and Chris Rooney. They’re from the USA and Canada. File that under “things that wouldn’t happen in most sports.” Surely some European referees would be up to the challenge. Canada 0-1 USA, 11:29 left, 1st period: The bulk of the crowd responds with “CAN-A-DA!” We need more creative cheers in the Olympics. Now Binnington comes up big on a deflected shot. Nearly a second for Boldy. Canada 0-1 USA, 12:00 left, 1st period: Watching the replay – how Toews managed to go through that play without interposing himself between Boldy and the puck is beyond me. Binnington just seemed shocked. And now the “U-S-A” chants start. Atrocious defense from Makar and Toews, as Boldy skates between them and flips the puck over their sticks, then beats Binnington one-on-one. A shocking lapse after a bright start. Credit to Boldy for the clever stickwork, though. Canada 0-0 USA, 14:00 left, 1st period: Despite that opening 80 seconds of pinning the Canadians back in their own zone, the USA haven’t managed a shot on goal. That just changed … Canada 0-0 USA, 14:36 left, 1st period: Tom Wilson of the 2018 Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals sends a shot just wide, then follows up with a trademark hit on the USA’s Dylan Larkin. (Yes, you can guess where I live.) Canada 0-0 USA, 15:49 left, 1st period: Suzuki drops it back to Stone for another Canadian shot. Pet peeve: When players congregate around a loose puck, that is not a “scrum.” Call it a ruck if you like. Or a maul. Canada 0-0 USA, 16:40 left, 1st period: Good rush for McKinnon’s line for Canada. Another tic-tac-toe combination, and Hellebuyck has to hang on. Canada 0-0 USA, 17:59 left, 1st period: Canada get the first official shot of the game, easily held by Hellebuyck. Canada reclaim the puck and force a scramble in front of the net. Each team gets a few good shoves at each other. This is not the NHL, so players do not want to get in a fight. Canada 0-0 USA, 18:40 left, 1st period: Good hit from McDavid, but the USA maintain possession and send a shot whistling past the net. Canada simply can’t get out of their own zone for more than a minute. Away we go … What else has happened at the Games today? And what were some of the highlights of the past two weeks and change? Check our multisport coverage: Stadium countdown at 7 minutes. Plenty more time for more “Miracle”-themed programming. This is, coincidentally, the 46th anniversary of the Miracle on Ice, and the US men have not won it since. In that time, they’ve reached the final twice, both times in North America, and lost both of them. The US men have never won gold outside their home country. The famous win was, of course, in 1980. They also won in 1960. NBC, meanwhile, has brought out 1980 men’s hockey legend Mike Eruzione to talk about what it means to play for the USA. He says this is the best US team ever assembled. He also notes “there’s not a TV set in Canada that isn’t tuned to this game,” and that’s probably not an outlandish statement. The United States will be facing a hostile crowd at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena as they seek their third ever Olympic title in men’s hockey and first since the Miracle on Ice team of 1980. The Americans were greeted with a chorus of lusty boos when they took the ice in their white jerseys for their 20-minute warm-up ahead of today’s gold medal game. It already felt like there were more Canada shirts in the building and along the concourses of the brand-new 14,700-seat arena on Milan’s south-eastern edge. Now it sounds that way too. It is arguably the hottest ticket of the Milano Cortina Olympics and that’s clear from the scenes outside the gates, where hordes of Canadian and American fans in hockey sweaters are pounding beers and roaring through songs and chants in glorious 53F (12C) sunshine. And now it’s the saddest moment of every four years … Olympic curling is over. Anna Hasselborg goes back-to-back, and my fantasy team dominated. What was your favorite moment of the Olympics? Alysa Liu’s gold medal performance? Megan Oldham soaring to two medals? Snoop Dogg showing up at curling? Send in your favorites, and I’ll run through them during intermissions. So many USA-Canada showdowns in Italy this year. Women’s hockey gold to the USA. Women’s curling bronze to Canada. Fitting that the Olympics will draw to a close with the two North American rivals facing off in the last event, the men’s hockey final. As in 1980, the hockey tournament has political undertones, but things are quite a bit different when each team has a gaggle of NHL players, not a Soviet Union team shrouded in mystery when it’s not dominating on the ice. And this time around, don’t expect any underdog-rallying speeches in the US locker room that will be commemorated on film. Personal story: When Sidney Crosby scored the overtime winner for Canada on home ice in 2010, I was at high altitude browsing a gift shop in Whistler, where I had just ridden the breathtaking Peak-to-Peak gondola. I made sure the other patrons didn’t know I was from that other country. Crosby will be missed in this final. But this is still the star-studded final hockey fans wanted to see. Enjoy. A big early blow for the Canadians. Their captain, Sidney Crosby, has been ruled out of today’s game. The 38-year-old has won two Olympics golds and three Stanley Cups, but did not play in his team’s semi-final win over Finland due to a knee injury. Canada coach Jan Cooper said on Saturday he would wait until the last minute before making a decision on Crosby’s participation. “We will see. I watched him skate today and we will meet tonight,” said Cooper. “He won’t put himself in harm’s way, and he will not put the team in harm’s way.” Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s what the players said ahead of today’s game: The US and Canada are prepared for a stormy men’s ice hockey final on Sunday as the long-time rivals face off for Winter Olympic gold. This year’s Olympics mark the first time NHL players have competed at the Winter Games since 2014, meaning many of the best players in the world will face each other on Sunday. While Canada are the betting favourites – and have won the most ice hockey golds in Olympic history – the US players say they have motivation to upset their northern neighbours. “There’s hatred there,” USA’s Brady Tkachuk told ESPN on Saturday. “I mean, they’ve been the top dog. They’ve been the best for the last bunch of years, and for us, we want to be in that position, be the best. So it’s going to be a game where I think a lot of guys could say, this is the biggest game that they’ve ever played in.” The rivalry between the teams has sharpened recently, particularly as political tensions have risen between Canada and the United States. At last year’s 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, Canadian fans booed the US anthem and there were a number of on-ice fights. Canada’s Connor McDavid acknowledged there is extra spice when his team play the US. “It is the game everybody wanted and hoped for, and it will be a great game,” he said. “It now comes down to one game between two teams. It is a hockey game, and we are excited about that. Team Canada playing Team USA in a hockey game – that is what it is. You can read the full story here:"
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:03:25Z,"Baftas 2026: the red carpet, the ceremony, the winners – follow live! ","On the red carpet, Glenn Close is telling Dazed magazine that the line “I’m not going to be ignored, Dan” from her role in Fatal Attraction is still stuck in her head. Close, who is presenting an award later, definitely isn’t being overlooked in this beautiful black coat with shimmering silver embroidery detailing. The 78-year-old has hot-footed it from the Erdem show at London fashion week, where she sat front row next to Helen Mirren. We haven’t seen Stormzy on a red carpet in a little while. His last big appearance was at the 2025 Met Gala, where he wore an unbuttoned white dress shirt over a vest from Haider Ackermann’s debut collection for Tom Ford. Today, the rapper has gone for a traditional tuxedo and accessorised it with a little red rose brooch in place of a corsage. The look is smart, chic and shows why a tux is an all-time classic. Kerry Washington, who is presenting an award later, has chosen a trailing gown from Prada for the occasion. The navy dress features some gorgeous floral applique detailing around the bustier. We wouldn’t like to be tackling any steps with a train that long, especially in front of an audience but, then again, we are not Hollywood stars. A little light reading For anyone who fancies some homework before we know the final results, here’s a primer: The full list of nominations Peter Bradshaw’s predictions News on who’s nominated and who isn’t, plus more on the snubs The identity crisis facing the Baftas Why awards-show hosting is the worst job in the world, plus more on this year’s host, Alan Cumming The best Bafta moments in history – ranked (features a fantastic photo of John Hurt) All the best Hollywood stylists will tell you the trick to nailing red carpet style is to wear something you are comfortable in. Paddington Bear has taken this advice and ran with it. The bear from Peru has stuck to his signature blue wool duffel coat and red felt hat. We’ve recently seen duffel coats on the catwalks of designers including Coach and Simone Rocha, and the Oasis star Liam Gallagher, so Paddington is very on trend. He hasn’t overlooked the glam, either. Those claws look particularly shiny – perhaps the result of pre-carpet pawdicure? Hello everyone, Chloe from the fashion desk here. For the next two hours I’ll be overseeing the good, the great and the downright bizarre looks on the red carpet. The first to arrive is this year’s host Alan Cumming. The presenter and host of The Traitors US is known for his love of a flamboyant look and he is not disappointing here. No doubt, Cummingwill change for his actual presenter duties, but for his arrival he has gone for a gradient coloured coat covered in tassels. Swishing along the red carpet, Cumming demands attention. Stand by for a closer look at his hair. Here is Chase Infiniti, who is nominated for best leading actress for her role in One Battle After Another. The American has gone for strapless burgundy fluted gown which, thanks to a carpet’s similar colouring, gives the illusion that she is hovering above ground. To Infiniti and beyond! As I said Cumming, loves a flamboyant look and nothing says theatrical like swirls of neon feathers glued to one’s scalp. It’s just the fun start we needed. Hello everyone, and welcome to the Guardian’s liveblog of the 2026 Bafta film awards. This is exactly the place to be if you enjoy celebrating the best cinema of the last year. It is also the place to be if you like looking at pictures of famous people being visibly surprised by dour weather, but that’s probably less important. As always, the Baftas need a little bit of explaining, so here we go. As we speak, the red carpet is already in full swing at London’s Royal Festival Hall. Two hours from now the ceremony will begin, where it will run for between two-and-a-half to three hours. However, that will mean nothing to television viewers, because the BBC’s broadcast of the ceremony doesn’t begin until 7pm. Clear? So here’s how the next few hours will go. Any moment now, Chloe MacDonnell will start bringing you the best looks from the red carpet. Then, the show will start, and we’ll all pretend that we don’t know who the winners are. And then, at 7pm, I’ll cover the glorious two-hour BBC broadcast. After that, we’ll just keep dancing until we’re all exhausted. Now that the housekeeping is over, we have a lot to look forward to tonight. More than most years, the Baftas are shaping up to be a pretty decent bellwether for the Oscars. One Battle After Another leads the way with 14 nominations, while Sinners follows with 13 and both Hamnet and Marty Supreme close behind on 11 each. It might also be the night that The Ballad of Wallis Island finally gets the awards it deserves, which would be very exciting. But this is all to come. For now, kick back and enjoy yourself. It’s going to be a long night."

Tullis-Joyce almost gives the ball straight to James under pressure. 19 min: The game is settling into a rhythm.

The American winger wins a corner for the home side. Manchester United get us under way, kicking from right to left. Meanwhile, Sonia Bompastor spoke about Manchester United’s unbeaten run. We know we are facing a really good team. They are in really good form and there have been a lot of wins in the games for them recently. So we are prepared for that and, as usual, the training this week has been good. Manchester United manager Marc Skinner spoke about the timing of the fixture in his prematch press conference. On Sunday we’re playing one of the best teams in English history, and it’s an early-round draw – but that’s football. That’s the beauty of the cup. There’s an element of luck in competitions. Drawing Chelsea might feel like rough luck, but that’s part of it. It’s what makes the cup special. In most year’s today’s game would be a cup final. At least one of the two teams has made it to the FA Cup Final in the last five years, including the 2022-23 and 2024-25 seasons when they faced each other. Yesterday’s only FA Cup fixture saw second-tier Birmingham City thrash fourth-tier Chatham Town 8-0. You can read Tom Garry’s match report here.

Today’s game is a repeat of last season’s final in which Chelsea won 3-0 to complete a domestic treble. While Chelsea are still fighting on four fronts, the prospect of Sonia Bompastor’s side winning another treble is no longer on the cards after back to back defeats against Arsenal and Manchester City in the league. But they bounced back with wins against Spurs and Liverpool to put them within a point of Manchester United in the WSL. Meanwhile, Manchester United are buoyant. They haven’t lost a game since November and Marc Skinner registered his 100th win with the club when they beat Atletico Madrid 2-0 to complete a 5-0 aggregate victory over them in the Champions League on Wednesday. Today’s game will be preparation for when both clubs meet again next month in the League Cup Final. Kick off is at 1:30pm. Join me for updates."
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:02:00Z,France v Italy: Six Nations rugby union – live,"“Italy must be more accurate,” says their former skipper Segio Parisse on ITV. Dan Biggar says it’s “been a funny kind of game,” pointing out that Italy have maybe been the better team. White we munch on our halftime orange, George G wants to remind us of the history between these nations: You mentioned the Garibaldi Cup. Worth noting Garibaldi was born in Nice when it was still part of the Italian kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. So if he was a rugby player I think he’d qualify for both France &amp; Italy. Nice was handed to France in exchange for French military help in Italian unification so Garibaldi later lamented he’d become a foreigner in his own home town. Interesting stuff. Wonder what position he’d play? France almost score with a superb strike move! Dupont missed Ramos off the scrum but the 10 was on the loop and had it off his centre before a delayed pass found Drean on a blind run. The winger darted for the right corner but was shunted out about two metres short. That bring an energetic half of rugby to a close. Italy can maybe feel slightly hard down by as the score doesn’t quite reflect the flow of the game. But France are so clinical. Back in a bit. 40 min: Italy spill the restart. How frustrating. That hands France a chance to strike on the visitor’s 22 just before the break. A swinging left boot and Italy chip away at the deficit. 39 min: Italy win the scrum penalty! They’ve already handed out lessons to Scotland and Ireland. Now the Italian pack is getting the better of the monstrous French heavies. It’s well within range and Garbisi calls for the tee. 38 min: Italy enjoying a spell on the ball between halfway and France’s 22. But they’re not really going anywhere. France’s defence has them comfortably at arm’s length and, in an attempt to up the ante, Garbisi throws a forward pass. France make a change in the front row ahead of this scrum. Cros makes way for Neti. Another Tolouse man in a team stacked with them. 36 min: Jegou flings a wild pass that is gobbled up by Italy on halfway. Too eager and they get away with it. Menoncello chases the kick but LBB is there to watch ti bobble over the try line and dots down safely. 35 min: France show unreal continuity in close quarters. Dupont found Meafou with a delicious off-load. Eight phases from a scrum on the 22 and they’re a couple of metres short. Gailleton took his eyes off the ball in midfield and Italy manage to push France back to the 22 and come up with the steal! They set themselves up for an exit and Fusco hoofs a kick that is partially charged down. France come again from halfway. France shoot themselves in the foot! Credit must go to Italy. They launched a counter down the right with Menoncello who kicked upfield and had the ball stop jus short of the French line. Ramos ran back and flicked it up for Attissogbe who didn’t kick but tried to run it back from his own line. He was swarmed by three Italian cleaners and when the ball bobbled lose the Italian fullback was there to dot down. The conversion from the right of the poles is missed. What a game we have here! A bolt from le bleu! From nothing. Italy had the line-out but overcooked it, missing their jumpers. France hacked ahead as the ball bounced and it fell into the breadbasket of Gailleton who exploded upfield and away from the chasing Italians. When he ran out of room down the left tram he found Ramos back infield. The 10 pinned his ears down and went for the corner before finishing under contact. Sublime. Three red zone visits. Three tries. Ramos dusts himself off and nails the tricky conversion from the left. 28 min: Italy win the line-out just beyond France’s 22 and maul it into the red zone. It stalls and Fusco is told to use it. Menoncello hits a lovely line and makes about 10 metres before he’s dragged down. But the ball is pinched! By Dupont! Is there anything he can’t do? So strong to snatch it out of Menconcello’s hands as the Italian centre was held up in the air. 26 min: Italy have it on France’s 22. They’re building. Eight phases. Menoncello on the right. 10 phases. Garbisi hoists a high cross-field into France’s 22 and Drean does really well under pressure to hold on and take the mark. 23 min: Italy close again! Superb down the left wing with Marin bursting through contact and he kept going. Capuozzo was in support. He then found Lynagh who didn’t off-load to the support on his left. The cleaners lost their feet and gave away a penalty five short of the French line. Brilliant but not brilliant enough. Shortly after France gave away an accidental off-side from their line-out. Think they used to call those a truck and trailer. 21 min: Italy understandably wanted to put pressure on that French scrum but were pinned for going straight on the angle. Ferrari penalised. Ramos missed touch though so Italy can build on halfway. 20 min: Italy come so close from that line-out. It goes swiftly off the top and two lovely delayed passes from Garbisi for blind runners round the corner – first Lynagh off his wing and then centre Marin – has the ball go coast to coast and short about a metre or two from the left corner. They then keep it with the forwards but two carries later the ball is spilled and Meafou hacks a clearance. They’ll come back for a French scrum on their own line. 19 min: Italy win a penalty inside France’s half but turn down the option of taking the three points. Garbisi punts it out to set up a line-out on their right about 20 metres from the try line. 18 min: Italy just about come away with the ball from their line-out, but they can’t punch through midfield. France are bossing the point of contact. Fusco has no choice but to hoist a box. He finds touch over halfway. 17 min: Attissogbe proves he can play at 15 as he comes within a metre of landing a 50-22. Still, that’s a great kick. Pressure on Italy back in their own patch. So clinical! Off the line-out they went down the line. Ramos had a dart himself, coming to within a metre. Both centres Gailleton and Brau-Boirie did likewise. Dupont chucked an overhead pass to Drean on the right wing before moving back infield. Then, with the Italians scrambling, Dupont hit a short pass for Meafou on a good line and nhe barged over from close range. Ramos doesn’t add the extras from right of the sticks. 13 min: Ramos now nails a 50-22! Poor from Italy. Off first phases Garbisi lifts a nothing kick that Flament grabs and flings to Dupont. He then finds his 10 who lands a wonder kick that dribbles out for a French throw inside Italy’s red zone. 12 min: Ramos overcooks a kick from first receiver off the scrum and its out on the full. Italy will get the line-out in French territory on the 10m line. 11 min: This time Nicotera finds his jumper legally but the ball is lost is contact shortly after. Will be another scrum to France, between their 22 and halfway. 10 min: That was a steal from Menoncello who pinched the ball and stifled the French move. Dupont, on his 22, hoofs it out around halfway. Italy are holding their own. 9 min: Solid scrum from France after a little delay. Attissogbe joins the line but loses it in contact. Goes backwards though so France, through Gaileton, continue. Theres a steal, Zuliani has it and kicks ahead. Italy counter. Attissogbe cleans up on his own 22 and France survive a scare. 7 min: Disappointing from Nicoetera. His first throw is skew and since France contested it’ll be a change of possession. Scrum to France. They could have gone for the line-out. Curious how this goes. 6 min: LBB has it on the left wing and chips and chases and almost gets it. Ramos dictating play. Solid from France. They get the line-out as Italy went back to cover LBB’s kick. France win the ball and set about another attack in the middle of the park. OH! But Italy win a penalty on the floor. Great breakdown work from L Cannone who got over the ball in a flash. Eight matches in a row for LBB! That’s a Six Nations record and my goodness, he is simply unreal! So quick. It was from broken play, Dupont got hold of a loose ball and swifly hoofed ahead. LBB exploded onto the ball, blitzing the covering defence and dotted down. Ramos slots the extras. I think it’s fair to call the French winger a cheat code. 3 min: Italy put a high kick on Attisogbe who doesn;t hold on but the bounce is kind and France keep possesion. Until it’s ripped away and the Italians attack down the left. A big hit from Drean stops momentum. Italy forced back to their 22 and they run it. Capuozzo dances. Energetic start from both teams. 1 min: Capuozzo wins the ball and Italy turn possession. They kick long and France have it back. Dupont, from his 22, kicks as well. Both teams feeling each other out early. Strange to see Italy in red. Italian rugby federation (FIR) explained: “The jersey is entirely in ‘ Garibaldi Red ‘, a color reminiscent of the jackets worn by Garibaldi’s soldiers and which has become synonymous with values such as heroism and indomitable spirit, which the Italian athletes perfectly embody on the pitch.” A reminder that both teams compete for the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy, name after the revolutionary who helped forge the unified nation of Italy. Righto, Garbisi in red kicks off and away we go! Anthems time. Is this the best combination of national anthems in our sport? The players are getting ready to leave the tunnel as we switch over to the commentary on ITV. This might not be in Paris, but it still looks like the centre of the world. If I’ve said it once I’ve said it a thousand times, no other nation, even South Africa or New Zealand, put on a show at the rugby like the French do. They just make it feel so epic! Bad news for the mercurial 10. Although it’s hardly a downgrade as Ramos, who has found himself at first receiver this campaign, slots in at 10. The wonderful Attissogbe shifts fullback (very keen to see how he gets on there) and Dréan comes on at 14. Did I mention French rugby has deep pockets? In the last five games between these teams, the team that has scored the first try has won just once. Slightly warped as France have won four of those, with that aforementioned draw, but it shows that registering the first try doesn’t guarantee success. Oh, and there are some World Rugby ranking points on offer. France sits third on the charts, while Italy are in 10th. Not that it counts for much, but after 51 Tests, France have a 47-3 record against the Italians with just one draw between them. That came two years ago when Paolo Garbisi hit the post with the last kick of the match as the teams shared the spoils after a 13-13 stalemate. I covered the MBM in that game. Was a belter. Fingers crossed we get another one. This might be the first real test of France’s scrum The Italians dominated both the Scottish and Irish packs and are a formidable force in the set piece. Danilo Fischetti is one of the form props in the game. But he’s not just a battering ram. He’s pretty handy in the loose too and has made 15 carries this year for more post-contact metres (28) than any other prop. Some reading on yesterday’s action while we gear up for this one: If the Opta supercomputer is to be believed, this is as good as over before its started. The machine that works in mysterious ways informs me that France have a 92.2% chance of winning with a predicted score of 41-18. Sounds about right to me. I’ve had a shocker. As reader Gavin Daly points out, “‘The game is being played in Lille!” My apologies. That’s corrected. I hope no travelling fan made the same me! The lightning feet of Ange Capuozzo returns after a spell out with injury while Italy starts with the same pack that featured in Dublin last Saturday, with Michele Lamaro captaining the side from blind-side flanker. Capuozzo slots in at fullback, replacing Lorenzo Pani who misses out on the match-day 23 entirely. That’s the only change to the starting XV from last week. A bunch of regulars are still missing, including Ignacio Brex who remains unavailable for family reasons. Italy: 15 Ange Capuozzo, 14 Louis Lynagh, 13 Tommaso Menoncello, 12 Leonardo Marin, 11 Monty Ioane, 10 Paolo Garbisi, 9 Alessandro Fusco, 1 Danilo Fischetti, 2 Giacomo Nicotera, 3 Simone Ferrari, 4 Niccolo Cannone, 5 Andrea Zambonin, 6 Michele Lamaro, 7 Manuel Zuliani, 8 Lorenzo Cannone. Replacements: 16 Pablo Dimcheff, 17 Mirco Spagnolo, 18 Giosue Zilocchi, 19 Federico Ruzza, 20 Riccardo Favretto, 21 David Odiase, 22 Alessandro Garbisi, 23 Paolo Odogwu. Fabian Galthie has named an entirely new second row and not dropped an ounce of quality. Those are some deep pockets the French coach has and he’s reached down and plucked out Thibaud Flament and Emmanuel Meafou to replace Charles Ollivon and Mickael Guillard, both of whom drop to the bench. More heft, less jazz then. It’s the same backline that has done the business so far as Antoine Dupont and Matthieu Jalibert continue to forge the most exciting halfback combo in the game. On the bench, Peato Mauvaka, Georges-Henri Colombe and Pierre-Louis Barassi come in for Maxime Lamothe, Regis Montagne and Noah Nene. France: 15 Thomas Ramos, 14 Theo Attissogbe, 13 Emilien Gailleton, 12 Fabien Brau-Boirie, 11 Louis Bielle-Biarrey, 10 Matthieu Jalibert, 9 Antoine Dupont, 1 Jean-Baptiste Gros, 2 Julien Marchand, 3 Dorian Aldegheri, 4 Thibaud Flament, 5 Emmanuel Meafou, 6 Francois Cros, 7 Oscar Jegou, 8 Anthony Jelonch. Replacements: 16 Peato Mauvaka, 17 Rodrigue Neti, 18 Georges-Henri Colombe, 19 Charles Ollivon, 20 Mickael Guillard, 21 Lenni Nouchi, 22 Baptiste Serin, 23 Pierre-Louis Barassi. It’s already been a weekend of shocks. Not necessarily in terms of results. After all, Ireland are a side still capable of mixing it with the big boys of world rugby and you’d expect Scotland to have the measure of a struggling Welsh outfit. But did anyone see the shellacking handed out to England on their own patch? And what about the Welsh? Did anyone really predict that they’d be leading right til the 75th minute? If we can take anything from Saturday’s action its that we can’t take anything for granted. France should romp to victory. They are, for my money, comfortably the second best team in the world and overwhelming favourites to secure a grand slam. But Italy are no mugs. They’re well coached, tenacious on defence, adventurous on attack and have more than a handful of genuine superstars. Don’t be too surprised if the visitors in red provide one more shock before we close out the weekend. Kick-off at 3:10pm in Lille (4:10pm local time). Teams and updates to come."
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:01:24Z,Tottenham v Arsenal: Premier League – live,"As for Arsenal, following the collapse at Wolves, Arteta makes one change, bringing in Leandro Trossard for Noni Madueke. That means Bukayo Saka’s sojourn in the middle, behind the striker, is over for now – a shame, in mine, as they need him involved in the play as often as possible, and have decent options out wide. Now that you ask, I’d have gone with Eze left and Madueke right – Arsenal need to let opponents, especially such poor ones, worry about them. But as we discussed earlier, change is right there for us, but isn’t easy to effect. So that’s two attackers, Kolo Muani and Simons, with 58 games for Spurs this season between them … and five goals. The Tottenham WayTM or what? Sky reckon Spurs are going 4-1-2-3, with Sarr on the wing; that sounds odd, but then so does Palhinha at centre-back. Otherwise, Dominic Solanke, who had some kind of throat situation, is left out in favour of Randal Kolo Muani, who Tudor had at Juve, and who’s managed three goals in 27 appearances so far this season, all of them in Europe. Back to Tudor’s first Tottenham team, loads of players are missing, injured – Destiny Udogie, Kevin Danso, Lucas Bergvall, Ben Davies, Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro – in that context, Thomas Frank can consider himself extremely unlucky. Even with everyone available, it’s a poor side, but without all those mentioned, how is he supposed to do anything? And yet it’s also fair to say that his way of playing did not look like one that could be upscaled for a team wanting to dominate, and when you lose the crowd as he did, justifiably so, there’s no coming back. I’ve not a clue who Spurs go to next, though: where on earth do you find a manager players will join for, who plays attractive football that enabled them to compete against better funded, more enticing rivals? Mauricio Pochettino is the only person to do it post-David Pleat in 1986-87, so perhaps they’ll get him after the World Cup, but does he have the same in him again, the English game having progressed without him and Harry Kane now in Munich? We’ve so much other sport for you it’s an absolute joke: I’ll level with you: it’s taken me the last 15 minutes to try and work out what on earth Igor Tudor is doing. I’m guessing it’s Palhinha in the middle of a back three, because managers trying to force a 3-4-2-1 on players unsuited to it has such a strong recent history of Premier-League success. I can’t say I’m entirely sure how you can win a football match with two attackers on the pitch but, on the plus side, he and his XI will have to go some to deliver a performance as pointless and as cowardly as Thomas Frank’s lot did when these sides convened at Arsenal earlier in the season. I’m not sure I’ve seen a side asked to do less to record a 4-1 derby win. Tottenham Hotspur (a possible 3-4-2-1 that could ba anything): Vicario; Dragusin, Palhinha, Van de Ven; Gray, Bissouma, Sarr, Spence; Gallagher, Xavi; Kolo Muani. Subs: Austin, Richarlison, Tel, Solanke, Souza, Olusesi, Williams-Barnett, Rowswell, Wilson. Arsenal (4-3-3): Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Hincapie; Zubimendi, Rice, Eze; Saka, Gyokeres, Trossard. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Mosquera, Calafiori, Lewis-Skelly, Norgaard, Madueke, Martinelli, Odegaard, Jesus. Referee: Peter Bankes (Lancashire) There’s a therapeutic idea that we create ourselves afresh every day, in full control of the person we are – or, to answer the Stone Roses’ question, we’re not etched in stone but sketched in the sand. It’s a liberating, comforting, affirming – and daunting – reality. A liberating, comforting, affirming, daunting reality and not one easily inhabited, because changing ourselves is difficult – consider Mikel Arteta, to pick a name at random. His excellent work – albeit with serious boardroom backing – turned Arsenal from a rabble into title challengers but in each of the last three seasons, his desperate, flapping intensity and scalding sense of injustice surely transmitted to team and crowd, wins bringing respite more than joy and anything else disaster multiplied by travesty. We can’t say it’s been the difference; we can say it isn’t helpful. This season, his air is calmer, but convincing players who’ve experienced him that previously, things were one way but now they’re another, isn’t easily done – especially when you look like you’ve not slept in several decades. More than that, though, demeanour only covers part of our impact – attitude is equally important and until that is altered, Arsenal will remain locked in the image of old Artetz, heavy on organisation and meticulousness but rizz and swag deficient. Seldom is there a sense that anyone is having any fun. Consequently, a lack of freedom we might also characterise as a lack of confidence threatens to cost them a title they’ve spurned several opportunities to near-enough secure, failing every time they’ve had a chance to increase their lead to insurmountable proportions. And now, with the gap down to just two points, they face an away derby against a Tottenham side fighting relegation and eager to impress a new manager equally eager to impress the world, having had nine days to focus solely on this game. Ultimately, Arteta has built a team guided by principles of certainty and control, problem being football is an inherently chaotic and improvisational activity. It’s true that, for a while, Pep Guardiola upended this truism, but it was only possible, for the foremost football genius of the generation, first with four of the greatest players ever, then on a budget far in excess of any competitor – and since then, even he has had to change. It’s true that Arsenal might still set-piece, blanket defence and own-goal their way to the title; if they do, they’ll be champions as deserving as any. But restart prowess and general solidity are not the opposite of expressive attacking and exuberant confidence – rather they underpin it. So, can Arteta liberate, comfort and affirm himself to give his team the same? He still has time, but also, time is not on his side – and that is what should really daunt him. Kick-off: 4.30pm GMT"
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:00:41Z,My fortnight in a posture corrector: can this simple device help reduce back pain?,"When I sat at my desk this morning, I couldn’t slouch over the keyboard like I usually do. As much as I tried to hunch over, my back was held straight, shoulders pulled back. My trick? I was wearing a corset-like device with straps over my shoulders that forced me into an upright position. Posture correctors claim to provide instant improvement in posture and relieve the back, shoulder and chest pain often associated with poor posture, if worn long term. The one I have on, Vicorrect (£29.99), is one of many on the market – Lidl’s budget posture trainer (£7.99) is now sold out; Taylor Swift has been spotted wearing a sports-bra version by Forme (£140). I have a history of bad posture. I usually spend more than eight hours a day working on a laptop – sometimes at my home desk with an adjustable office chair and external monitors, but also on the sofa, at the dining table or even in bed. By the end of a typical workday, my shoulders, neck and back are painfully stiff, despite weekly trips to the gym and swimming pool to try to loosen them up. I recently visited a massage therapist, who gasped at how tight my shoulders were and told me, with a look of alarm, that I must improve my posture. An instant fix in the form of a wearable item is very appealing. But can you really “correct” your posture with a harness? David Harris, a clinical director and clinical specialist physiotherapist at Oxford Circus Physiotherapy, says they are “definitely not something I’d recommend as a standalone solution for someone with poor posture, but if they asked whether they could wear one, I would say yes – for short periods.” Traditionally, he says, good posture “is having a straight line running through your body”, where your ears are directly over your shoulders and your shoulders are directly over your hips. “But we’re busy human beings and we can’t sit in the perfect posture all day. The key is changing positions regularly. You don’t want to become reliant on a brace to stay upright.” Harris says occasionally wearing a posture corrector may benefit your proprioception – “improving your ability to sense where you are in space and getting your muscles to hold you in that position”. The corrector pulls the shoulders back, which he says could be useful “to learn the right position for your body to be in”. However, long-term, “we really want the muscles to work to hold that position, too”. And for that, muscle strengthening is essential. The Vicorrect comes with a user manual that recommends wearing the device for 30 minutes a day, building up to a maximum of three hours to “improve your alignment over time”, warning that it may cause discomfort or even pain to those not used to it. On first look, it resembles a mix between a Victorian corset and a bondage harness. It includes a back brace that sits snugly around the waist, with two hard plastic rods to ensure the back is kept straight, and when I tug on the arm straps, my shoulders are forced back. My bones click worryingly. Vicorrect doesn’t specify how long the corrector should be worn for in total – but it says at least three weeks. During my first 30 minutes, I notice a significant difference in my posture while I work, mainly because I can’t round my shoulders like I usually would. But after I take the corrector off, my posture slowly returns to its usual state. The scale of poor posture is difficult to measure. It is tough to quantify something not everyone agrees on – ideas of “good” and “bad” posture vary between cultures and time periods, and one study of 295 European physiotherapists even shows some disagreement between countries. A research paper published in 2019 argued for a re-evaluation, stating that “despite common posture beliefs, there is no strong evidence that one optimal posture exists”, and that variations in posture are more reflective of beliefs and moods than health. The impact of poor posture is also hotly debated: while there is some evidence that a forward head posture (known as “tech neck”) can cause neck pain, an umbrella review of evidence suggests that poor posture does not cause back pain. Alison McGregor, a professor of musculoskeletal biodynamics at Imperial College London, tells me that “the direct link between poor posture and back pain is actually quite tenuous”. Sitting with poor posture can be uncomfortable, she says, but it’s not usually the cause of back pain: “If anything, poor posture is a sign of weak muscles, which can also cause back issues.” Over the next few days I follow the posture corrector’s manual and increase my wearing time to 45 minutes a day. I typically throw the corrector on as soon as I start work and wear it in the privacy of my own home, but one day I forget until the evening, when I am heading out to a friend’s dinner party. The product listing states it can be worn for sitting, walking or exercising, so I put it on and head out to catch the tube. I quickly discover that wearing a posture corrector on a hot rush-hour train is a special kind of discomfort. As I’m squeezed into the back of a carriage, the back brace becomes increasingly claustrophobic. By the time I arrive at my stop, I’m covered in a thin sheen of sweat and tumble out on to the platform like a fish gasping for air. The humiliation is doubled when I show my friends the corrector and one of them says it looks like the harness she puts on her dog. The next day, I ask McGregor about the possible benefits of wearing a corrector. “It can sometimes be useful to remind people they’re slouching,” she says, “but strong muscles to support your spine are the biggest part of maintaining good posture.” She notes that this includes back muscles as well as hip, pelvis and core muscles – but warns that these “won’t develop by wearing a brace that does the work for you – they’ll just get lazier and weaker.” Spurred on by this warning, the next day I head to the gym and do reverse flies, an exercise recommended by Harris to help my rounded shoulders. I wear the corrector, as its listing claims it can be worn during workouts, but it slides uncomfortably over the fabric of my gymwear and quickly bunches up under my chest, so I take it off. Harris advises that the kind of exercise an individual should do to improve their posture varies: “It’s usually very specific, depending on what their muscle imbalance is, and it has to go hand in hand with changing environmental factors and examining any joint stiffness.” He was able to provide some tailored advice after I told him about my particular areas of pain, but recommended that anyone seeking their own workout routine should speak to a physiotherapist first. However, there are some things many people can do to improve their posture that don’t have to include a regular gym routine. “A lot of our posture is related to our behaviour – we are what we do repeatedly,” McGregor says, “so improving it can just be about restarting the body to work again.” This could include going for short walking breaks, or reminding yourself to sit upright and engage your core muscles. McGregor adds: “It’s important to break up long periods of sedentary behaviour with movement and be mindful of how you’re sitting.” The downside of behavioural changes like these is that seeing the results takes time, which could be why people are turning to devices that promise a quick fix. “Humans will inherently find the easiest way to do something, and it’s easy to slouch or sit in a comfortable chair all day,” McGregor says. For a lot of us, “the thought of having to work at our health is sometimes quite hard.” It can take six to eight weeks for exercise to start having an impact on our posture, she continues, and “human attention span often isn’t that good. We just want to take a tablet to get better.” As the fortnight draws to a close, wearing the posture corrector feels increasingly like a chore, with minimal impact on how I sit, and I’m convinced the brace around my stomach is giving me acid reflux. My posture has improved – my shoulders are more relaxed, my back is straighter – but it’s impossible to say whether it’s because the corrector has forced me into shape and made me more aware of my body, or because I went to the gym and worked on my back and core. I will keep the posture corrector for occasional use, but I’m wary of letting a device that works in place of my muscles become a new bad habit. I don’t want my back to weaken further, making me reliant on a brace to sit upright, and the lack of research linking poor posture and back pain is striking when a primary selling point of many correctors is their ability to relieve it. Perhaps regular exercise, bodily awareness and frequent movement are better than buying something that promises to do the hard work for you, no matter how tempting it may be."
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:00:41Z,Lib Dems call on home secretary to delay new dual national border rules,"The Liberal Democrats have called on the home secretary to “move at speed” to delay the rollout of new border controls that could result in British dual nationals being blocked from entering the country. A letter sent by the party to Shabana Mahmood echoes one sent by the former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis on Friday asking for a grace period to be implemented urgently after one of his constituents told how she could no longer visit her dying mother in a care home in Yorkshire. Families have told of flights cancelled to funerals, 80th birthday parties and visits to elderly and dying parents. Young parents who were forced to take out citizenship in the EU because of Brexit, but whose children do not yet have British passports, have also been hit. From Wednesday British dual nationals risk not being allowed to board a plane, ferry or train unless they present a current or expired British passport or a “certificate of entitlement” costing £589, which takes eight weeks to obtain. “It is unacceptable that British citizens could be penalised,” said Will Forster, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for immigration and asylum, in the letter to Mahmood also signed by 23 other Lib Dem MPs. No British citizen should be denied the right to come home “simply because of badly-communicated and ill-thought-out administrative changes”, the letter said. It added: “I would urge you to move at speed to introduce a grace period to protect those affected.” Davis pointed out that Google trends showed a huge jump in searches for passport inquiries in the past week. Searches for “passports” were made 20,000 times, up 10% overall, but searches for “dual passports” were up 90%. He told the Guardian on Sunday: “The Home Office really has to take this seriously because a British person’s right to live or enter their own country should not be stopped by their own government, full stop. If she [Mahmood] doesn’t take this seriously, this issue will not go away and it will continue to be pursued.” One young British woman who has been in touch with the Guardian said she and her partner were considering cutting short their honeymoon in New Zealand because her husband, who is from Scotland, does not have a British passport and travelled on his New Zealand papers. “We heard about the change while out for dinner in a restaurant in Auckland and are now facing ending our honeymoon considerably early at massive expense or being stranded abroad. While trying to find any guidance or help, we’ve been passed from one government office to another with no interest or help from any,” said the woman over email. She said they had also gone to the consulate in Auckland but everyone there said “it’s nothing to do with them” and a phone line designated as “help for British people” cut out. One parent in the US trying to get a first time passport for his dual national son before a trip to see elderly parents said it was impossible to get one quickly. “Despite me being British born with a British birth certificate, we need to get original birth certificates and marriage certificates of all four grandparents. Some of those documents are close to 100 years old and the people are long since dead,” he said. Airlines are obliged to comply with rules or risk fines, making it difficult for those with flights after next Wednesday to know whether they can travel. British immigration lawyers said one solution would be to temporarily treat British dual nationals like tourists, allowing them to buy a £16 electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to get into the country. “Policy groups are calling upon the Home Office to simply allow dual nationals to apply for and hold ETAs – which is sensible. The Home Office should step back from its rollout, which is causing unnecessary deep damage to the goodwill of overseas British citizens,” said Alex Finch of Constantine Law. He pointed out that the Home Office on Friday published a partial “fix” saying that carriers may allow dual nationals to board if they have an expired British passport issued in 1989 or later along with a valid passport for a nationality eligible to apply for an ETA. “But that still leaves anyone without a qualifying expired British passport in an uncertain position,” said Finch. The Home Office said it “strongly recommends” a British passport for smooth travel. It said emergency travel documents were for available adults and children who had previously held a UK passport issued after 1 January 2006 “where the need for urgent travel meets the exceptional circumstances criteria”. It said: “From 25 February 2026, all dual British citizens will need to present either a valid British passport or certificate of ntitlement when travelling to the UK. Without one carriers cannot verify they are a British citizen, which may lead to delays or refused boarding. “Public information advising dual nationals to carry the correct documentation has been available since October 2024 and a substantive communications campaign about the introduction of ETA has been running since 2023.”"
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T15:58:40Z,"Winter Olympics 2026: China’s Gu soars to gold, build-up to the closing ceremony and more – live","With USA claiming the final gold medal of the Games, here are the final standings in the Milano Cortina 2026 medal table: Jack Hughes has scored the overtime goal to give USA a slightly fortunate win in a game where Canada certainly had the best of the chances. Beau Dure was watching this one: Klaebo’s medal count hit five on the day that Mikaela Shiffrin stood at the top of the podium once again after an eight-year wait. Bryan Armen Graham on Olympic redemption for the American: Alot can happen in 12 years. If you’re Mikaela Shiffrin, as a teenager you can become the youngest ever person to win the Olympic slalom, stack a couple more medals at the next Olympics, become the most successful World Cup skier of all time with a record 108 victories, go 10 more Olympic races in a row over three Winter Games without reaching the podium, overcome the two biggest crashes of your career and subsequent battles with self-doubt and post-traumatic stress disorder and eroding trust in your own skiing, and then bring it all back home with a second Olympic slalom gold. You can also lose your dad. Shiffrin, considered by many the greatest alpine skier in history, saw her incandescent career come full circle on Wednesday beneath the jagged limestone peaks above Cortina d’Ampezzo, winning her signature race by 1.50sec – an eternity in slalom racing and the largest winning margin in any Olympic alpine skiing event in nearly three decades – to end an eight-year medal drought that had started to overtake the conversation. In 2014, at the age of 18, she became the youngest US woman ever to win Olympic gold in alpine skiing. Now, in 2026, she’s the oldest at 30. With all the fun in the mountains, Milan needed some action to make you remember it was also hosting this Olympics. It was Italy’s blades of glory who delivered as the crowd powered the host nation to another gold medal. Davide Ghiotto, Andrea Giovannini and Michele Malfatti thrashed the world record-holders, world champions and favourites Casey Dawson, Emery Lehman and Ethan Cepuran of the US to win the men’s team pursuit gold medal in speed skating. Buoyed by raucous cheering from the home crowd, the Italians won their country’s first Olympic title in this event since the Turin Games in 2006, beating the Americans by a whopping 4.51sec – a lifetime in speed skating. As we continue our Winter Olympics lookback, there was to be more heartbreak for Kirsty Muir as she once again fell agonsingly short of a medal. Sean Ingle was in Livigno: This time, Kirsty Muir must surely have believed that a Winter Olympic medal was in her grasp. But as a thrilling big air competition reached its denouement, an Italian with no anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee came down a 180‑feet ramp and drove a stake through the Briton’s heart. It all looked so promising when the 21-year-old from Aberdeen landed a stunning left double 1620, with four and a half rotations, to move into the medal positions after two of the three rounds. However, with just four jumps of the competition remaining, Flora Tabanelli, who tore her ACL in November, did the same trick as Muir but only better to score 94.25 points to steal the bronze medal. “It was a little bit bittersweet,” said Muir, who fell on her final jump and finished fourth. “I didn’t know what she did, but I knew it bumped my score by a decent amount and therefore I really did have to go for it. I gave it my all and I’m taking that with me. We still have one more gold medal to hand out and it’s in the men’s ice hockey. We’re going to overtime after it finished 1-1 between Canada and the USA after three periods. Beau Dure is covering that one here: Day nine was a golden one for Team GB: Team GB chiefs have hailed Britain’s greatest day at a Winter Olympics after celebrating two gold medals, in the mixed snowboard cross and mixed team skeleton in Milano Cortina. Super Sunday started with Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale storming to a surprise victory in Livigno, with Bankes dramatically overtaking the French team with four turns remaining to take mixed snowboard cross gold. Less than five hours later, Tabitha Stoecker and Matt Weston added a second British gold in the mixed team skeleton in Cortina after Weston overturned a 0.30sec deficit following Stoecker’s run to beat Germany by 0.17sec. Elsewhere the Johannes Høsflot Klæbo gold medal count was up to four as he led Norway to victory in the men’s 4 x 7.5km cross-country relay at the Milano Cortina Games on Sunday to win a record ninth career gold medal at the Winter Olympics. The 29-year-old has won four gold medals at these Games and is widely expected to take another two in the men’s team sprint on Wednesday and 50km classic race on Saturday. Klæbo took over for the final leg with a lead of 12.2 seconds and extended it to 22.2 seconds by the time he crossed the line. France took silver and the bronze went to Italy. Sean Ingle has racked up some miles across northern Italy over the last few weeks, on day eight he was in Bormio where Brazil, yes Brazil, won an Alpine skiing gold medal: As the snow fell in Bormio, and the fog settled in, Lucas Pinheiro Braathen made history by becoming the first South American to win a Winter Olympic medal. Then, as the realisation that he had won gold for Brazil in the men’s giant slalom, he collapsed to the floor and allowed the tears to flow. “I just hope that Brazilians look at this and truly understand that your difference is your superpower,” he said, still sobbing away. “It may show up in your skin or in the way you dress. But I hope this inspires every kid out there who feels a bit different to trust who you are.” Erin Jackson of USA competes in the women’s 1000m speed skating; Sweden’s Elis Lundholm competes in the freestyle skiing women’s moguls qualifiers; Philipp Raimund of Germany celebrates after landing during the men’s normal hill individual final On the back of his helmet, Pinheiro Braathen has in big letters “Vamos Dancar” – “Let’s Dance.” And he certainly did that on his first run, establishing a stunning 0.95sec lead over the Swiss legend Marco Odermatt. One week into the Winter Games and Team GB had its first medal, a golden one at that. Matt Weston was the man to do it, in the skeleton. The 28-year-old broke the track record at the Cortina Sliding Centre four times in succession, and won in a combined time of 3min 43.33sec, which was almost a full second ahead of the runner-up, Germany’s Axel Jungk. “I’ve been fortunate enough to win world championships, and European championships and other things, and this blows them all out the water,” Weston said. “I almost feel numb. I keep touching this medal to make sure it is real.” In Milan, American figure skating icon Ilia Malinin fell twice as Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov stunned the field to win Olympic gold. Bryan Armen Graham was at the Milano Ice Skating Arena: For nearly two years, Ilia Malinin has made men’s figure skating feel predictable in the most spectacular of ways. On Friday night on the southern outskirts of Milan, the Olympic Games reminded the sport, and perhaps Malinin himself, that predictability is never guaranteed on its biggest stage. The overwhelming favorite entering the free skate, the 21-year-old American instead saw the Olympic title slip away to Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov after an error-strewn performance that will go down among the biggest shocks in figure skating history. Shaidorov’s season-best total of 291.58 vaulted him from fifth after the short program as one favored contender after another faltered. Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama (280.06) and Shun Sato (274.90) took silver and bronze respectively on a night where even the sport’s most reliable jump technicians struggled to hold their programs together. Indeed a storm did brew and on day six, it hit. Sean Ingle and Andy Bull were both across this one: Vladyslav Heraskevych has accused the International Olympic Committee of doing Russia’s propaganda for them after he was barred from racing in the Winter Games because he wanted to wear a “helmet of memory” in honour of Ukraine’s war dead. In one of the most controversial decisions in recent Olympic history, the Ukrainian skeleton racer was informed only minutes before he was due to compete that his accreditation had been rescinded. It followed a last-ditch meeting in Cortina on Thursday morning with the IOC’s president, Kirsty Coventry, who left in tears after she failed to persuade Heraskevych to change his mind. The IOC has maintained all week that the helmet, which shows the images of 24 athletes and children that died from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, violates its athletes’ charter because the field of play must be free from political expression. However Heraskevych, who had a genuine chance of winning Ukraine’s first medal at these Winter Olympics, has insisted that the helmet is an act of remembrance for the friends he has lost and that it would be a “betrayal” to back down. There was storm brewing on day five and it would be one that made the IOC look like the kind of out-of-touch sports body stuffed with dusty suits that everyone assumes it is. Here is Sean Ingle’s report: The Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says he is ready to be disqualified on Thursday because he does not want to betray his country’s dead athletes. In what is likely to be an extraordinary scene in Cortina when the skeleton begins at 9.30am local time (8.30am GMT), Heraskevych has vowed to wear his “helmet of memory”, even though the International Olympic Committee has told him it will kick him out if he does so. Heraskevych has continued to practise in the helmet, which shows 20 images of athletes and children killed since Russia’s invasion, despite the IOC banning it on Monday. “I will not betray these athletes,” Heraskevych said after finishing first on the final day of practice. “These athletes sacrificed their lives and because of this sacrifice I am able to be here so I will not betray them.” Day four and the big question for Johannes Høsflot Klæbo was could he win all six cross-country medals on offer? He was making other world-class athletes look as if they were chasing shadows. Klæbo cruised through the sprint classic and detonated the field on the final climb to claim his second gold of these Games. However, Klæbo was not even the biggest story in the Norwegian team at this point. Sturla Holm Lægreid broke down in tears after winning bronze in the men’s 20km biathlon, apologising for having an affair and saying: “It has been the worst week of my life.” Johan-Olav Botn won gold, with the Frenchman Éric Perrot in second, but it was Lægreid who stunned television viewers in Norway after opening up to the broadcaster NRK about his private life over the past six months. “There is something I want to share with someone who may not be watching today,” he said. “Half a year ago I met the love of my life. The world’s most beautiful and nicest person. Three months ago I made the mistake of my life and cheated on her, and I told her about that a week ago. This has been the worst week of my life. “I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her. Sport has come second these last few days. Yes, I wish I could share this with her.” “I’ll be proud of myself in a minute,” the 21-year-old Team GB star Kirsty Muir told one reporter, through the sobs and the pain. “But I’m in a bit of a hole right now.” Muir had finished fourth in the women’s freeski slopestyle competition, the first of several near-misses for the British contingent and Sean Ingle was in Livigno: Everyone knows that fourth is the worst place to finish at an Olympics. But, for Kirsty Muir, this result stung like pouring a gallon of antiseptic on an open sore. Coming into this final, Muir knew she was a strong favourite for a medal. She had won this event at the X Games two weeks ago with a score of 93.66, before qualifying third here. On this day, it just wasn’t to be. Instead the Swiss star Mathilde Gremaud defended her Olympic title with a score of 86.96 points, while China’s Eileen Gu repeated her second place in Beijing with 86.48. While Muir knew she was not at her best, she felt that bronze was there for the taking. Day two was dominated by one dramatic incident 13 seconds into Lindsey Vonn’s attempt to win a miraculous medal as she raced with a complete ACL rupture in her left knee, along with a bone bruise and meniscal damage sustained a week before in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Here was Andy Bull’s take from Cortina: The Olympic career of Lindsey Vonn has ended in a sickening, split-second crash high on the side of the Tofane downhill run in Cortina d’Ampezzo. The American, one of the most successful skiers in history, had come out of a five-year retirement to compete in her fifth Games, and was hoping to become the oldest athlete, male or female, to win a medal in the downhill. Vonn was just 12 seconds into the race when her legs gave way beneath her as she rode a bump. She twisted, fell, and tumbled and, after the first stunned screams and shouts, the crowd all around the mountain fell silent in shock and worry. The USA team confirmed later that she was in a “stable condition and in good hands” following surgery after breaking her left leg. Her teammate Breezy Johnson was in the leader’s seat when Vonn went down. She covered her eyes because she couldn’t watch. Johnson, 30, was forced out of the last Olympic Games in Beijing after she had a bad crash here on this very same slope. She went on to win the gold in 1min 36.10sec, just four hundredths of a second ahead of Germany’s Emma Aicher in second. The home favourite Sofia Goggia, who lit the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony, was third. But the abiding memory of this race will always be the sight of Vonn on a stretcher, being evacuated from the mountain by air ambulance. Continuing with our rewind, day one brought an early gold for hosts Italy with the remarkable story of Francesca Lollobrigida. The silver medalist from Beijing 2022, struck gold for the first time in her fourth Olympics in the women’s 3,000m speed skating. Lollobrigida’s two-year-old Tommaso was hurried towards the ice to celebrate with his mother. In the mountains Franjo von Allmen was the last Swiss skier standing on the podium of the men’s downhill after an assault by an Italian team. Von Allmen won gold but the home crowd in Bormio enjoyed Giovanni Franzoni and Dominik Paris filling out the rest of the podium at the expense of pre-race favourite Marco Odermatt and Alexis Monney. Sweden also made a big splash on day one, with a one-two in the skiathlon as Frida Karlsson and Ebba Andersson took gold and silver respectively. What was your favourite moment of Milano Cortina 2026? Get in touch via the link at the top of the page. Hello all, the players are back on the ice for the second period in the ice hockey. Follow that one with Beau Dure: That is all from me today. Tom Bassam is back to take you through memory lane. It began with an opening ceremony at San Siro that showcased Italy’s rich cultural history of music, art, fashion and dance. The overarching theme was harmony – brining together what was different. Sean Ingle wrote: In the buildup, the creative director, Marco Balich, had promised that his team of artists and performers had devoted 700 hours of rehearsals to ensure everything would be perfect. They delivered – and then some. The show began with 70 dancers from Accademia del Teatro alla Scala, twirling and spinning in perfect time, across a background of classical statues. Soon there were also nods to Ancient Rome and the Renaissance, food and fashion, literature and design. There were also genuflections to Verdi, Puccini, Rossini and Armani. There were supermodels in red, green and white, the colours of the Italian flag, walking down a catwalk before the Italian national anthem was played. There was even a surreal section devoted to hand gestures – although none of the ones that are usually seen in Milan rush hour. These Games have been a joy to watch for winter sport experts but equally for those who tune in every four years and had to frantically Google: “What is ski mountaineering?” and “Why do Norway win every gold medal in existence?”. Emma John’s questions include: “Are Ed Leigh and Tim Warwood actually a disguised Joaquin Phoenix and Timothée Chalamet, deep in character for an upcoming reboot of Wayne’s World?” and “Are Canadians not the nice guys any more?”. Ice hockey: The Americans draw first blood against Canada! After breakaway and some deft puck handling, Matt Boldy puts his side ahead with their first shot on goal. Auston Matthews and Quinn Hughes assists. Follow along below for full updates. It was a slow start for Team Italy at Milano Cortina but once the hosts began to pick up medals in the second week, the public’s imagination was captured. Angela Giuffrida writes from Rome: If the streets in the Italian capital felt largely bereft of Olympics fever, the numbers told a different story. More than 1.27m spectators who had bought tickets by the event’s midway point, filling venues to an average 85% of their available capacity. For what has been the most geographically scattered Winter Olympics ever, that was no small feat. Held under the official banner of Milano Cortina, the Games stretched across almost 8,500 square miles, encompassing Alpine villages in Lombardy such as Bormio and Livigno, along with Anterselva and Val di Fiemme in Trentino-Alto Adige, before wrapping up with Sunday’s closing ceremony in Verona. The vast footprint presented complex logistical challenges for its organisers and athletes, and provided no single hub for its spectators to celebrate. Speaking to reporters last week, Andrea Varnier, the Milano Cortina Games chief executive, said: “We know that this is not a walk in the park.” He added: “We are completely aware that we are pioneers when it comes to this edition of the Games. We knew that we had many challenges and, after one week, most of them seem to have been overcome.” Read the full feature on how Italy fell in love with their home Games below. The Milano Cortina Games surpassed expectations despite a large number of obstacles in the run-up to the world’s biggest winter multi-sports event, the International Olympic Committee said on Sunday, ahead of the closing ceremony. The Games, which started on 6 February with a dazzling opening ceremony at San Siro in Milan, were under extreme pressure for years due to tight deadlines and a number of building delays, with the widely dispersed venues across northern Italy posing additional challenges for organisers. But when the curtain falls with the closing ceremony in the arena of Verona, organisers and the IOC can breathe a sigh of relief. “They have been fantastic,” the IOC president, Kirsty Coventry, said in her address to members at the Olympic body’s session. “It could not happen without incredible teamwork … and we had it every step of the way.” “Over the last two weeks we have seen and experienced incredible Games. I have no words really,” said Coventry, presiding over her first Games after her election last year. It was a completely different picture only a few weeks before the start, with organisers scrambling to complete the Santagiulia ice hockey arena as well as the newly built sliding centre in Cortina d’Ampezzo, a hotly debated project throughout preparations due to the cost and tight construction deadlines. “These have been very challenging, difficult years for a series of circumstances,” the Games chief, Giovanni Malago, said. “We never tried to find alibis. But we are all satisfied.” Despite vocal IOC opposition, Italy decided midway through preparations in 2023 to build a new sliding centre in Cortina. The IOC had suggested that organisers could shift the competition to another country and an existing sliding centre but the Italian government refused. It opted instead to build a new one, piling more pressure on the embattled organisers and angering the IOC. A series of protests took place on the day the Games began in the Italian financial capital to oppose the presence of analysts from a department that falls under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while the US vice-president JD Vance, present at the opening ceremony, was booed when shown on the stadium’s big screens. Such were the IOC’s concerns before the Games that when Malago, an IOC member, ran for a spot on the Olympic body’s executive board on the eve of the opening ceremony, he failed spectacularly. Around 48 fellow members voted against him in a clear snub. It is extremely rare for an IOC member of a host nation to face such opposition from fellow members prior to staging the Games. But when the Olympics got under way most operations went off without any major problems, surprising organisers. While Olympics traditionally struggle with teething problems or more serious issues that can affect venue operations or even a lack of atmosphere, the Games in Italy did not face a major crisis while the winter weather played along to offer impressive snowy Alpine backdrops. Initial transport concerns between Milan and the mountain clusters in the Dolomites eased almost instantly, mainly due to the limited number of spectators commuting between the two because of the long travel times that can reach six or seven hours. Most fans chose to stay in either Milan or in the mountains. The European time zone of the Games also meant increased viewership across the continent and the key market of North America, compared to the previous two winter editions held in Asia. The Games also got a major boost domestically with Italy picking up 30 medals, including 10 golds by Sunday morning, to make the top five on the medals table, and increased viewership and ticket sales during the Games with several hundred thousand sold during the competitions, to bring the total to about 1.5 million from 1.2 million at the start of the Games. “Thank you for never ceasing to believing in us,” Malago said. “For supporting us in the most difficult moments and there were not a few. Together we were stronger than any challenge and any adversity.” Here, we will be looking back at the last two weeks of sporting action and looking ahead to tonight’s closing ceremony. In the meantime, get in touch via the email at the top of the blog and send over your most memorable moment from these Games. Ice hockey: I will be providing key moments from the men’s ice hockey final but if you want full updates, follow along with Beau Dure in our dedicated live blog. If you’re just joining us, here is what has happened so far on the final day of the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympic Games: Eileen Gu defended her Olympic ski half-pipe title to make it six medals in six events over her Winter Games career. The 22-year-old Gu is already the most decorated freeskier in the short history of the sport at the Olympics. She won the event on the strength of her second run, a clean, technically sound pass and got even better in her final run to finish with a score of 94.75. Her teammate, Li Fanghui, took silver and Zoe Atkin of Britain was third, upping GB’s medal tally to five. Sweden’s Ebba Andersson surged away from her rivals to secure a commanding win in the 50km classic cross-country ski race, winning the first gold medal in the event on its Olympic debut. It was redemption for Andersson, who suffered a series of falls in the relay that likely cost her team a gold medal. She also has three second-place finishes at Milano Cortina, one earned after an impressive comeback in the relay and individual silvers in the skiathlon and 10km freestyle event. Germany’s Johannes Lochner collected his second bobsleigh gold of these Games in the four-man event, completing a hugely dominant week for the sliding superpower. Compatriot and double-defending champion Francesco Friedrich took silver but Germany’s hopes of a first-ever clean sweep in the event were spoiled when Michael Vogt snatched bronze for Switzerland on the final run. Sweden beat Switzerland for women’s curling gold to conclude the sport’s competition at Milano Cortina. It was Sweden’s sixth curling Olympic gold and 13th medal overall the sport, trailing only Canada in both categories. After upsetting top-ranked Canada in the semi-finals Anna Hasselborg’s Sweden defeated Silvana Tirinzoni’s Switzerland 6-5. Canada beat the United States for bronze on Saturday. Sidney Crosby is out for Canada in the men’s Olympic hockey gold medal game against the United States after a right knee injury. Crosby skated in a closed practice on Saturday. The 38-year-old left Canada’s quarter-final against the Czech Republic and missed the semi-final against Finland. Connor McDavid wears the captain’s “C” again. He leads the tournament with 13 points in five games. The final stone dislodges Switzerland’s red and there it is. Sweden win 6-5 to win their second Olympic gold eight years on. What a result for Anna Hasselborg and her team! Curling: Sweden are just hitting their shots perfectly. Switzerland have one last chance to disrupt the yellow stone in the middle … Curling: Huge end for the Swiss as they score two to level it all up against Sweden – 5-5 as we go to the 10th end. Bobsleigh: The Great Britain pilot, Brad Hall, speaks to BBC Sport after a seventh-place finish in the four-man bobsleigh: It’s very difficult to put into words to be honest. It’s pretty devastating to finish where we did today but we weren’t in the place we wanted to be overnight and we said we were going to come out fighting and do the best we can – and that’s what we feel like we did. It didn’t work out the way we wanted it to but we have so much to be proud of over the past four years – world championships medals, European champions and World Cup medals as well so, it’s just sucks to end a four-year Olympic period with a result like this. It’s difficult to put into words right now. Curling: Sweden steal one in the women’s final after an error from Switzerland’s Alina Pätz with the hammer. The Swedes now lead 5-3 with two ends left to make up for it. Ice hockey: Some big breaking news for the men’s ice hockey final. Canada’s captain, Sidney Crosby is out of the gold-medal game against the United States. The two-time Olympic champion, will play no part due to an injury sustained in the quarter-final win over the Czech Republic after a heavy hit from the defenceman Radko Gudas. The 38-year-old has two goals and four assists in four games this tournament. Connor McDavid will continue to wear the ‘C’ in Crosby’s absence. You can follow our dedicated live blog for the final with Beau Dure below. Gold for Johannes Lochner and his team, as the Beijing 2022 gold and silver medallist pilots swap places in 2026! That is a fifth Olympic gold for Thorsten Margis, part of Lochner’s crew. He won two-man and four-man gold in 2018 and 2022 as part of Friedrich’s team. Francesco Friedrich (Germany) takes silver and it is bronze for Michael Vogt’s Switzerland sled! Great Britain’s team comprising pilot Brad Hall, Greg Cackett, Leon Greenwood and Taylor Lawrence finish seventh. Thanks Tom and hello all. Let’s see how those medals shake up then … Right, to see you through to the conclusion of this one is Yara El-Shaboury. I’ll be back in a bit. Ammour can’t go clean for the Germany third team and that guarantees a bronze for the Swiss! The third German team post a 3mins 38.68secs overall time. The fourth-place Swiss put down their quickest start and Vogt delivers in the pilot seat. They’ve put the pressure on Ammour’s German unit in the bronze medal position, with an overall time of 3mins 38.64secs. Big roar for Baumgartner’s crew go for Italy, but they’re losing time all the way down and can’t move up from fifth. Unfortunately Hall can’t go quicker, it’s not his cleanest run and the British four finish in 55.03 for a total time of 3mins 39.12secs. It looks like a seventh-place finish for Team GB. Follador’s team for Switzerland go down in 54.94 so their four-run total is 3mins 39.03secs. Brad Hall’s GB team were on the same time ahead of that Swiss run, can they go better? Now we’re turning our focus back to the bobsleigh. Here’s the top five ahead of the final runs: Germany (Lochner) - 2mins 42.86secs Germany (Friedrich) - 2mins 43.34secs (+0.48secs) Germany (Ammour) - 2mins 43.78secs (+0.92secs) Switzerland (Vogt) - 2mins 43.87secs (+1.01secs) Italy (Baumgartner) - 2mins 43.96secs (+1.10secs) Switzerland and Team GB are joint sixth on 2mins 44.09secs (+1.23secs off the lead) Quick update on the curling. We’re into the sixth end and the Swedes lead Switzerland 3-1. For a full look at the updated medal table, hop over to our live page here. Email from Chris Page: Gutted for Zoe, but very proud. I think the judges were unnecessarily harsh. But my mind is now turning to the upcoming Paralympics, especially the Wheelchair Curling. It requires even more skill and finesse than the non-disabled variety, as there’s no sweeping involved. Let me know your thoughts on the action via the link at the top of the page. Cross country is a mad sport, 49km of gruelling skiing and then a sprint uphill. Super human athletes. Right, here are the final places in the cross country: Ebba Andersson (SWE) Heidi Weng (NOR) Nadja Kälin (CHE) Here comes Diggins, but she can’t get past Fosnæs on the climb. Kälin still leads this mini-race and is pulling away. It’s bronze for Kälin! Nadja Kälin of Switzerland has a little lead going into the last climb and Kristin Austgulen Fosnæs of Norway is just behind her. Jessie Diggins of USA is on their tale, she could go past on this incline. Norway’s Weng comes in to take silver, who will take bronze? This will comes down to a sprint. Andersson goes into Klaebo mode on the final climb and enters the stadium all alone. She’s been the silver lady so far in this Games, but now gets her golden moment. Taking a brief switch over the cross country, Sweden’s Ebba Andersson has a huge lead with less than 5km to go. She well away for gold and Heidi Weng has a decent gap for second, but the shake up for bronze could be interesting with five athletes all in with a shout. So after a fall on her first run, Gu shows nerves of steel to improve with each of her next two runs. Zoe Atkin led after the first runs but despite improving her score to 92.5 on her final effort she falls just short of Li Fanghui, who bagged silver. Here are the final standings: Eileen Gu (CH) 94.75 Li Fanghui (CH) 93 Zoe Atkin (GB) 92.50 She put it all out there, the height was massive and she lands a switch 900 to finish but the judges only gave her 92.50, meaning she’s 0.50 short of silver. That’s Team GB’s fifth medal of the Games, adding to the three golds and one silver. Zoe Atkin goes for gold.. Li Fanghui is guaranteed a medal, will this see her move into gold? It’s clean, technical and greater difficulty than her second run. That’s a 93, meaning Zoe Atkin needs slightly more to move up from bronze. Indra Brown puts in her best run, she’s a long way off the medals at the moment, but will that change? She goes to 87, for fifth place. Eileen Gu shuns the 1080 but her run is better than the one that scored 94 but it only improves her scored by 0.75. The task for Zoe Atkin and Li Fanghui is not impossible but is a little bit harder. The BBC boys are surprised that doesn’t score higher. Zhang Kexin is yet to land a run, but she can put up big scores. Ooooo, that’s the first 1080 we’ve seen in this final and that was an impressive technical run. It wasn’t big on the height and the score of 83.25 reflects that. What can Amy Fraser do? She’s fourth currently and that’s a big run. There was a lot of switch tricks in there but not a lot of height. It’s good enough for 88 and that won’t win a medal for the Canadian. This is good, Svea Irving skipped the second run after a bang on the first run and I thought she was out, instead the American is going to give it a go. Unfortunately she calls it early after fighting the landing on her second trick. Rachael Karker is next, but she falls coming off her jump. The Canadian’s 79.50 puts her in fifth for now. There’s no improvement from Mischa Thomas, she finishes with a best of 77.75. We’re into the third runs and Kate Gray get down her first full run. The American gets a 66.5. Liu Yishan is next and she improves her score to 71.75 but that’s not troubling the podium. After getting a huge 5.4m on the first jump she takes a fall halfway down. Such a shame she was looking very good for an improved score. More to come on run three, you hope. So after the second runs the medal positions are: Eileen Gu (CH) 94 Li Fanghui (CH) 91.50 Zoe Atkin (GB) 90.50 Li Fanghui appears to take a bit of a slip coming off her first trick and also misses a grab but again the judges overlook those execution errors because of the technichality on show. The Chinese athlete goes second with a 91.50. Indra Brown’s second run is better than her first, but only by ten points. Paying for a lack of airtime. Gu makes it down this time and even though there’s a missed grab in there it’s still packed full of hits. It’s not got the height of Zeo Atkin’s run, but finishes with back-to-back alley-oops, so how will they score it? Wow 94. Gu goes into gold medal position. We have a final. Zhang Kexin is next and is putting together something very impressive before she takes a huge fall. Eileen Gu is next. Sadly, Svea Irving’s fall in run one has put her out of the rest of the competition. Rachael Karker of Canada this time manages to land her run and the BBC commentary lads are suprised as she’s given a 79.50 to go ahead of Thomas into fourth. Amy Fraser, the Canadian sitting second, puts down a similar run to the first and doesn’t improve her score. Mischa Thomas seems like a character. The New Zealander doesn’t clock it’s her turn to go until the camera switches on to her, before she drops her phone halfway down the run. A camera man grabs it for her as the judges decide she didn’t improve on her first round 77.75. Kate Gray falls on second run and doesn’t improve her score, then Liu Yishan puts down another clean run, but not one that is massively better than her first. That is what the doctor ordered! Huge first trick from Atkin gets 4.5m of air and her average of 2.7m is higher than the peaks achieved by anyone else in the final! Do the judges love it? They do! It’s 90.5, easily the best score so far. So after the first runs the medal positions are: Zoe Atkin (GB) 90.50 Amy Frasher (CAN) 85 Li Fanggui (CH) 81.25 We lost Canada’s Cassie Sharpe to concussion before the final so we move next to Li Fanghui of China. It’s a good one, a lot of switch, which apparently the judges love. That’s an 81.25 and good enough for second. Only Amy Fraser has put down anything of top quality so far, but what can Zoe Atkin do? Australia’s Indra Brown starts well but loses momentum, it’s a clean run but not the biggest. It’s only a 55.4, but that’s good enough for fourth with the amount of falls we’ve seen so far. Wow! Eileen Gu goes off next and she pulls up after first trick. Pressure on for the Chinese athlete as she has to score with her second and third runs. Zhang Kexin rides more of the pipe backwards than forwards before falling. That’s better from Amy Fraser. The Canadian is clean and technically really strong, she misses a couple of grabs but that’s the best so far, 85. We have more falls as Canada’s Rachael Karker and then Team USA’s Svea Irving both hit the deck. This final was postponed from last night due to heavy snow so these conditions are not easy. Liu Yishan, the first of the four Chinese athletes, is clean but not the highest scoring at 70. Mischa Thomas is next for New Zealand, the BBC commentary boys like it (when do they not?), and it’s good enough for a 77.75. It’s not her best, with a stumble on the last trick for a 44.55. She has two more runs to improve that score. First to put down a run is America’s Kate Gray… We’re heading over to Livigno shortly for the women’s halfpipe. Team GB’s Zoe Atkin qualified first but there is plenty of competition, not least from China’s Eileen Gu. Some big news coming out of the 50km women’s cross-country skiing, with Frida Karlsson pulling out. The Swede was the gold meal favourite having won the skiathlon and the 10km intervals, as well as a silver in 4x7.5km relay. The Americans have a disaster run there. They’ve lost more than a second, largely as a result of a huge tap and fishtail coming out of the start ramp. They’ll be tumbling down the rankings. I’ll have those standings in full later ahead of the fourth and final runs. Brad Hall’s Team GB are next. They get off quick with 4.78 start but with perfection required this is a little short. There are a couple of errors in turns one and two, with speed not picking up further down the course. The time of 54.66secs is much better than their second run (55.04) but Lochner’s team is further off in the distance, 1.23secs ahead. Team GB are only 0.31 seconds behind third-placed Ammour’s third-place German crew but that’s a lot to ask in one run. The Swiss are less clean with their run, but they post their second-quickest time (54.69) which sees them lose ground on the team above them. The Swiss are down in 54.55, quicker than Ammour’s sled in the third run but not quick enough to move up into the medal positions. Neither can the Italians, who get down in a tidy fashion but a lack of speed out of the gate sees them post a 54.57 and remain a couple of hundredths off bronze. Next up… more Germans. Adam Ammour is the pilot for this one and that is (relatively) less impressive than his rivals. That run opens the door for the bronze medal spot, they’re 0.96 behind Lochner’s crew. Lochner’s team start 0.6secs faster than Lochner’s team but he’s losing time further down the track and the 54.30secs finishing time means the time advantage for the leaders grows to 0.48secs. We’re straight into it with the four-man bobsleigh. The leaders, the Johannes Lochner’s German crew are down in 54.25, not his best but not far off. Now what can Francesco Friedrich do with Germany’s second-place team? This is the end, sadly. Day 16 is here and with it, the closing ceremony. But that’s later and for now we still have a final few events to tick off, with medals to be handed out. One of those medals may even go the way of Team GB’s Zoe Atkin, in the delayed women’s ski halfpipe final. Before that we have the final runs in the men’s four-man bobsleigh, where – unsurprisingly – Germany lead and also sit in silver medal position. Brad Hall’s British crew are seventh. Later on we have what the second installment of what is argualy the most gruelling event in the whole Games, the 50km cross-country ski mass start. After Johannes Høsflot Klæbo won his sixth gold of the Games in the men’s event yesterday, today it is the turn of the women to push themselves uphill on skis for more than two hours (sounds fun). Another high-profile event concludes today with a showstopper of a final in the men’s ice-hockey as the USA take on Canada in a re-run of the feisty Four Nations finale from last year. Canada beat the USA for bronze in the women’s curling yesterday and the gold medal match starts just after midday, with Switzlerland facing Sweden. I think that’s everything covered off, shall we get into it?"
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T15:39:40Z,Huckabee’s Israel land remarks condemned as ‘dangerous and inflammatory’,"Governments from across the Islamic world have condemned remarks by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, suggesting it would “be fine” for Israel to claim a broad swath of the Middle East. Huckabee, an evangelical Christian pastor and former Arkansas governor, has long been an outspoken supporter of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories. In an interview with the conservative US commentator Tucker Carlson published on Friday, the ambassador pointed to verses in the Bible that some Jews and evangelical Christians interpret as signifying the divine right of Jews to claim the land from the Nile to the Euphrates. “It would be fine if they took it all. But I don’t think that’s what we’re talking about here today,” Huckabee said, suggesting that it was Israeli restraint that prevented the Jewish state from exercising its biblical claim. “We’re talking about this land that the state of Israel now lives in and wants to have peace in,” the ambassador said. “They’re not trying to take over Jordan, they’re not trying to take over Syria, they’re not trying to take over Iraq or anywhere else. They want to protect their people.” Huckabee later admitted his remark had been “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”. But the suggestion that Jews had a divine right to a large part of the Middle East drew a furious response from Muslim governments around the world. A joint statement signed by a list of countries including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan, said the ambassador’s comments were “dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region.” The US embassy in Israel insisted the comments had been taken out of context by the states making the complaint. “US policy has not changed,” the embassy said in a statement. “The narrative was based on an edited portion of a response. If one listens to the full context Ambassador Huckabee clearly says that Israel has no desire to change their current boundaries. Any characterization otherwise is a misrepresentation of the full and unedited response.” In other comments in what appeared to be an unedited video of the interview with Huckabee that Carlson published online, the ambassador appeared to claim that the roughly 60% of the West Bank under direct Israeli control (known as Area C) was an integral part of Israel, in apparent contradiction to Washington’s official position opposing annexation of any or all of the occupied territories. “Area C is Israel,” Huckabee said. The ambassador also gave an expansive interpretation of the biblical areas of Judea and Samaria, ancient geographical terms that Israel uses to refer to the West Bank. Huckabee seemed to go even further. “Well, you basically take the Jordan River, and it’s west of the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea to the Lebanon border,” Huckabee said, again suggesting that Israel had been generous in ceding territory. “Israel did have control of the Sinai. They gave that to Egypt. They had control of it. They gave it away in 1979 in the peace agreement. “Israel has shrunk the land. They have made that decision,” he said. “That’s why they gave away Gaza. They’ve given away a lot of things.” The often tense and combative interview illustrated a rift within the US right over how far the US should go in its support for Israel. Carlson challenged Huckabee repeatedly on whether his claim of the biblical rights of all Jews to settle in the territory between the sea and the River Jordan was defined ethnically or religiously. Huckabee appeared to argue that it was both, meaning that someone who was born Jewish but converted out of the faith held the right to settle there, as well as someone who converted to Judaism."
